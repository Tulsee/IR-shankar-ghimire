    "abstract": "Access to adequate finance can significantly impact the well-being of refugees. Lack of access to funds can lead to poor living conditions, limited access to education and health care and a lack of economic opportunities. While the refugee finance gap is particularly acute in low- and middle-income countries, refugees in both advanced and emerging countries are affected due to the lack of regulations and relevant financial products. There is a lack of awareness of the financial needs of refugees among financial institutions. Therefore, we adopt a qualitative research design and propose a conceptual Qard Hassan-based crowdfunding model to reduce the global refugee finance gap. Our conceptual model is unique and can provide greater flexibility and adaptability for refugee finance. The model could be adapted to different contexts and regions. We also make policy contributions, as our proposed crowdfunding model can help to ensure that the funding is provided in a way that is tailored to the specific needs of the refugee community in various locations."

It complements the literature by providing information on the role of higher education institutions in developing skills for the circular plastic economy. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a mixed method approach drawing on reflective analysis on qualitative data from 5 focus groups and 12 semi-structured interviews, and structural equation modelling of quantitative data from 151 students across 4 Nigerian Universities. Findings: The results indicate that Nigerian university students are more likely to participate in the circular plastic economy through a high prominence of soft power features such as increased awareness, inspiration, idea generation, encouragement and capacity building. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is with the sample. A larger data set, including other tertiary institutions such as private universities, polytechnics and schools of vocational studies, would strengthen the results. Practical implications: The study underlines the importance of targeted policy interventions and pedagogic innovations to drive awareness and knowledge building among Nigeria’s youth population. Originality/value: This study makes a novel contribution by using empirical evidence to determine the predictors of student participation in the circular plastic economy. This understanding is important for the development and implementation of appropriate policies that promote participation in the circular plastic economy. Furthermore, given the typical youthful age bracket of university students, any plans to achieve a systemic shift in the plastic value chain must involve the young generation."

Secondly, it contributes to current accounting literature by examining an ancient manuscript from the 14th century, which serves as a foundation for understanding the Islamic accounting system within the context of accounting, religion and spirituality. The paper further contributes by arguing that this conceptualisation of religious accounting as a value-based approach enables its practitioners to evaluate their own accountabilities in delivering on socioeconomic objectives related to inter-human/environmental, social and financial transactions within the context of religious accounting practices."

Using data from 2019 to 2024, we apply a novel DCC-GARCH-based R 2 decomposed connectedness approach to analyse return connectedness among these high-risk assets. We also utilize innovative concepts such as minimum dynamic pairwise connectedness and minimum R 2 decomposed connectedness portfolios in our multivariate hedging portfolios. Our findings reveal that total connectedness is time-variant and influenced by economic events. Bitcoin and Ethereum are identified as net transmitters of shocks, while other assets, particularly gold-backed cryptocurrencies, serve as net shock receivers with minimal impact. Moreover, few EMSIs (financials, industrials, and materials sectors) show significant connectedness in the system. Although our suggested portfolio analysis offers improved returns, none consistently outperform the market. This research offers valuable insights for investors and policymakers regarding the interconnectedness and risk management of cryptocurrencies and EMSI."

We then test the impact of CSI on their cost of equity capital. Our results reveal that higher CSI activities of firms raise their cost of equity financing, although this positive relationship between CSI and the cost of equity capital is shaped by the firms' systematic risks and the institutional environment in which the firms operate."

    "abstract": "Purpose: This research aims to examine how financial literacy moderates the mediation of attitude toward virtual influencers’ non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or ATB on the relationship between purchase intention and self-congruity, which includes symbolic representation, self-image congruence and emotional value. Initially, we investigated the mediation effect of ATB on the relationship between self-congruity and purchase intention. Subsequently, we analyze how financial literacy moderates this mediation process. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a sample of 383 virtual influencers’ fans and applied a partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM) along with robustness tests to test the research hypothesis. The analysis is based on the moderated mediation framework. Findings: The findings are intriguing for several reasons. First, it reveals that only self-image congruence positively affects purchase intention, contrary to existing self-congruity theory literature. The relationship between self-image congruence and purchase intention is a direct relationship with no mediation effect of ATB. Second, ATB fails to mediate the self-congruity effect on purchase intention. Third, financial literacy has a negative relationship with purchase intention, indicating that fans of virtual influencers with higher financial literacy are less likely to purchase virtual influencers’ NFTs due to more critical investment evaluations. We also argue that financial literacy discards the consumption behavior effect from self-congruity variables on purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the literature by emphasizing the significance of financial literacy on purchase intention under the self-congruity framework. It also surmises that self-image congruence does matter for the purchase intention of a virtual influencer’s NFT. However, further research could validate findings by studying broader NFT investors, incorporating fandom and impulse buying variables and examining actual NFT purchases against planned behavior. Practical implications: This research is crucial for virtual influencers’ NFT creators, marketers and fans by providing insights for evaluating virtual influencers’ creators’ decision to pursue NFT markets. The findings reveal that the creators of virtual influencers should reconsider pursuing the NFT market, as self-congruity may not be a driving factor. Notably, our findings imply that a virtual influencer’s NFT is significantly different from a virtual influencer's merchandising business. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in extending the self-congruity within the NFT context, investigating how financial literacy moderates the mediation of ATB on the self-congruity-purchase intention relationship. It challenges self-congruity theory by showing that despite fans feeling aligned with virtual influencers, high financial literacy reduces the congruence."

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study investigates how the quality of corporate governance practices reduces the likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies. By developing a Corporate Governance Index (CGI) based on 52 criteria from the regulatory framework, the hypothesis is tested that companies with higher CGI scores are less prone to becoming Zombie companies. The study aligns with the agency theory framework, highlighting the significance of effective governance in mitigating financial distress and preventing firms from becoming Zombies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of 3,051 listed Indonesian firms from 2014 to 2022, excluding financial and utility companies. Data were sourced from the Bursa Indonesia website, focusing on annual reports. Continuous variables were winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. The analysis involves developing a CGI tailored to the Indonesian context and examining its impact on the likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies. Endogeneity concerns are addressed to ensure robustness. Post-hoc analyses investigate the roles of political connections and family ownership in the firm’s propensity to become Zombie firms. Findings: The results demonstrate that higher CGI scores are associated with a reduced likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies, supporting the agency theory. Post-hoc analysis reveals that political connections and family ownership significantly contribute to a firm’s Zombie status. However, the influence of CGI remains crucial regardless of these factors. The findings are consistent with the literature, emphasizing the importance of effective corporate governance in preventing Zombification. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the academic literature by highlighting the importance of using a governance index to assess the impact of governance practices on firm dynamics. It highlights the relevance of corporate governance quality in understanding and mitigating Zombie theory. The research suggests further investigation into the role of CGI in helping companies transition from Zombie status to financial health and exploring the influence of upper-echelon variables on the CGI-Zombieness relationship. Practical implications: From a practical standpoint, the findings advocate for the enhancement of control and monitoring mechanisms in firms, particularly regarding debt risk-taking decisions. Policymakers are encouraged to institutionalize the use of governance indices to evaluate firm performance. The study suggests extending such regulations to non-listed firms and SMEs to prevent the proliferation of Zombie companies. Effective governance practices are crucial for mitigating risks associated with political connections and family ownership. Originality/value: This study provides a fresh perspective on the impact of the Corporate Governance Index on firm Zombieness within the Indonesian context. By tailoring the CGI to the specific regulatory framework, it offers reliable insights into the role of governance quality in preventing firms from becoming Zombies. The study bridges a gap in the literature by linking agency theory with Zombie theory, emphasizing the necessity of effective control and monitoring to avoid financial distress. The research highlights the pivotal role of corporate governance, even in the presence of political connections and family ownership."

Using ESMI’s strength relative to GSMI, we assess how EU policies, financial crises, and cross-country disparities in economic, business, and market conditions influence integration, employing both machine learning and econometric models. The results indicate that ESMI is predominantly influenced by GSMI. Among potential drivers, differences in expected corporate performance across EU member states, i.e., expectation disparity, are the most significant. In contrast, EU-level policies exhibit no or only short-lived effects. Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic appear to increase ESMI through synchronized market reactions. These findings suggest that EU financial integration is heavily shaped by global forces and internal asymmetries, thereby raising questions about the long-term effectiveness of EU integration policies.\nJEL classifications"

It presents an analysis of institutional ambitions, change measurement, ongoing initiatives, and their sustainability. Our study employed semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions of relevant stakeholders (staff and students) from four major Nigerian universities. Findings were categorised into two main dimensions. First, certain essential elements such as the strength of networks, entrepreneurial culture, and modelling good practices were identified as independent of management, constituting the bedrock of successful university entrepreneurial ecosystems. These elements, fundamental for fostering innovation, are intrinsic components of vibrant entrepreneurial environments within academic institutions. Secondly, the study illuminates features influenced by management, stakeholder engagement, and personalized relationships. These elements, encompassing aspects like infrastructure, funding, quality control management, and state-level policies, act as catalysts for development but are not obligatory. They function as path-dependent variables, leading to varying outputs. Despite their variability, these management-driven factors are indispensable for the evolution and scaling of university entrepreneurial ecosystems, forming the backbone of innovation within higher education institutions in Nigeria"

We show that insider trading in state-owned firms (SOEs) is statistically and economically more profitable and informative than in non-state-owned firms, indicating a unique political information advantage enjoyed by these insiders. Further analysis shows that insider trading in government-owned firms becomes more profitable during nationwide periods of political uncertainty and when industry-specific government actions are introduced. Moreover, the aggregate insider trading in SOEs better predicts future stock market returns than that in non-SOEs. These results suggest that the political information advantage of SOE insiders is evident in both the idiosyncratic and macroeconomic information content of insider trading, consistent with the superior ability of these insiders to interpret the economic impact of the country-, industry-, and firm-specific government actions."

This study aims to examine the relationship between managerial regulatory engagement (MRE) − a type of CPA − and access to bank finance, and how this relationship is moderated by country-level religiosity and religion policy regime. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from over 37,000 firms in 43 sub-Saharan African countries and drawing on resource dependency and institutional theories, the authors deploy robust and sophisticated statistical analyses to test their hypotheses. Findings: This study finds that MRE has a positive impact on access to bank finance. This effect is stronger in countries with more formal religion restriction where morality does not inhibit politicians’ discriminatory behaviour. However, this effect is weakened in countries where high levels of religiosity and more formal religion support curtail amoral rent provision. Originality/value: These findings shed light on how firms’ use of CPA to manage resource dependency is affected by the influence of institutional religiosity on the agency of politicians. This study offers important theoretical contributions to the literature and generate useful implications for managers and policymakers."

    "abstract": "The circular economy (CE) within the automotive industry has attracted the attention of business leaders, policymakers, and scholars in recognition of the negative impacts of the linear economy of ‘take, make, dispose’. In many developing countries, the absence of manufacturers and their approved service providers means that the automotive CE largely depend on informal micro-level CE business actors. These business actors are mostly clustered in networked mechanic villages and provide micro-level CE business opportunities. However, their micro-level CE practices and business potentials has not been explored in the literature. This paper addresses this important gap by drawing on Network Theory to show how the network CE practices of these business actors contribute to waste reduction, resource conservation, and CE eco-innovation. We also show a missing connection between the CE practices of these business actors and existing network business models that can be exploited for their benefit. We discuss our contribution in the context of the nuanced characteristics of the micro-level CE practices and business potentials that emerge from the network of these business actors. Finally, we recommend that automotive industry CE policies focus on integrating the practices of these informal micro-level CE business actors with macro and meso-level approaches."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Interest in using popular movies in higher education has flourished, but determining their actual impact remains tricky. Some studies suggest these movies can positively affect student satisfaction, yet many criticize this method as ineffective or lazy. Our study compared two ways of using popular movies – watching them in class versus a flipped approach – for an advanced finance module. We aim to examine the best teaching delivery of watching popular movies in an advanced module. Design/methodology/approach: This study compares two teaching methods during movie screenings: a didactic flipped classroom (Group 01) and in-class viewing (Group 02). The sampling frame was final-year finance students from a public university. It was conducted over two academic years and involved 190 students aged 20–23. These students were split into two groups: G01, with 93 students, and G02, with 97 students. The study focused on the movie “Big Short,” chosen for its relevance to the Fixed-Income Securities course (the advanced module). Findings: Our findings indicate both methods led to high student satisfaction, with no significant difference between in-class viewing and the flipped approach. However, the understanding of the advanced module significantly increased overall. Importantly, using popular movies as flipped material resulted in better student grades compared to in-class viewing. This suggests that while using popular movies is a beneficial teaching method, employing a didactic flipped classroom approach yields superior outcomes for students. Practical implications: This research offers practical insights for instructors, highlighting the value of utilizing popular movies in advanced education. It suggests incorporating movies as learning materials can enhance student satisfaction, particularly when employed within a flipped classroom framework. Importantly, the study reveals that adopting the flipped classroom approach yields superior academic outcomes compared to traditional in-class viewing. Thus, instructors teaching advanced modules should consider integrating popular movies within flipped classrooms to not only enhance student satisfaction but also improve academic performance. Originality/value: Our research investigates popular movies' efficacy, particularly in advanced finance education. While previous studies have explored using movies to enhance student satisfaction, this study investigates it further by comparing two delivery methods: the didactic flipped classroom and traditional in-class viewing. While both methods effectively increase student satisfaction, the didactic flipped classroom significantly improves academic performance. This highlights the innovative potential of the flipped approach in promoting deeper learning and suggests practical implications for instructors seeking to enhance both satisfaction and academic outcomes in advanced courses."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the spillover effects between hydrogen energy, nuclear energy, and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors in the context of the global clean energy transition, with a particular focus on the impact of climate policy uncertainty (CPU) and geopolitical risks (GPR). Employing the TVP-VAR extended joint connectedness approach, the findings show a high connectedness that indicates significant spillovers among these sectors. Hydrogen energy emerges as a dominant transmitter of shocks, reflecting its sensitivity to regulatory changes and fluctuating demand. However, nuclear energy acts as a stabilising force that offers hedging opportunities and resilience against market turbulence. The AI sector exhibits strong connectedness, primarily as a net receiver of shocks, driven by its dependency on clean energy sources and vulnerability to energy market volatility. Using the GARCH-MIDAS framework, the study identifies a temporal asymmetry in market responses to CPU and GPR. CPU triggers immediate but short-lived disruptions, while GPR induces delayed yet persistent effects that intensify cross-sector spillovers over time. These results underline the vulnerabilities of sectors reliant on regulatory clarity and geopolitical stability. This study provides practical insights for investors, policymakers, technology, and energy companies to better manage systemic risks at the crossroads of clean energy, technological innovation, and uncertainty."

Utilizing data from Chinese CBM&As activities from 2010 to 2018, we find that while relative political risk concerns deter deal completion rate, higher ESG standards of acquirer firms reduce this deterrence effect. The results remain robust to considering ‘duration of deal completion’ as an alternative variable and when splitting the target sample countries into developed and emerging economies. The key conclusion is that emerging market multinational companies can effectively employ ESG as a strategic tool for internationalisation, enabling them to overcome some of the inherent ‘liabilities of origin’."

    "abstract": "Despite the climate crisis, a significant barrier to sustainability is limitations to the current accounting and reporting system. These deficiencies, mean the global financial system continues to invest trillions of dollars annually in environmentally sub-optimal projects. To catalyze the economic transition away from fossil-fuel and plastic configurations to more sustainable ones, sustainability accounting and reporting (SAR) is imperative. However, theoretical contention, pragmatic concerns, and costs stoke strong resistance to SAR. The research used ablative thematic analysis to apply hermeneutic phenomenology. First, it scanned the backdrop to the SAR problem and identified a corpus of recent literature from key associated institutions. The initial interpretation of the texts disentangled SAR’s conflicting threads and generated three themes of ‘climate crisis’ and ‘conservative’ or more ‘radical’ SAR reform paradigms. Iteratively harnessing these thematic lenses, the investigation re-examined the SAR literature corpus. The textual ‘dialogue’ generated understanding of the fragmented SAR responses to the climate crisis. Accordingly, the research reformulated its first theme to ‘dystopic climate crisis fragmentation’ and refined the other themes to take account of materiality and the split between Anglo-Saxon (IFRS, SSAB) or global (UN) and continental European accounting institutions (EU, GRI). Conservatives retain a single materiality investor-focus and concede only incremental standard improvements. Radicals seek to implement double materiality with a broader spectrum of stakeholders in mind. Both approaches have theoretical as well as pragmatic advantages and disadvantages, so the SAR contention rumbles on. Whilst the standard-setting landscape is evolving, disagreements remain. Its roots of contention are philosophical and pragmatic. Philosophically, radicals strive to temper libertarian anarcho-capitalist proclivities and broaden firm responsibility. Pragmatically, social, or environmental externalities are problematic to assign or measure. Given vested interests in the destructive status quo, it would be naïve to expect a harmonious SAR Ithaca to emerge anytime soon. Yet the challenges impel an intensification of SAR dialogue and concrete actions. Rather than a scientifically nomothetic contribution, the paper provides a qualitative, artful interpretation of a complex, contentious but crucial field."

    "abstract": "The main objective of this research is to investigate the fisheries interconnectedness among fish-exporting nations and how the climate policy uncertainty (CPU) may affect that dynamic connectedness. Using data from January 2012 to June 2024, we conduct a two-stage analysis. In the first stage, we use a TVP-VAR model to analyze market interconnectedness. The results show that over half of the variability in export returns comes from cross-country spillovers, indicating strong global fish trade integration. Japan and Thailand are identified as key shock transmitters, while Chile and China emerge as major receivers. In the second stage, we apply DCC and ADCC-GARCH models to assess the asymmetric effects of CPU on fisheries trade. The results reveal that negative CPU shocks have a significantly stronger impact on market interconnectedness than positive shocks, suggesting that uncertainty and adverse policy shifts exert disproportionate pressure on fisheries markets. Also, the CPU has persistent, long-term effects on fisheries interconnectedness, highlighting the enduring nature of climate-related uncertainty in global trade. These findings challenge the “One Ocean Hypothesis,” which has gained attention since COP25 in 2019. This study contributes to the marine economy literature by demonstrating how CPU shapes the relationships among fish-exporting nations. The results have practical implications for policymakers and industry stakeholders, surmising that climate policies in one country can influence fisheries markets worldwide."

Data were collected from non‐financial companies listed on the FTSE Emerging Asia Pacific index from 2018 to 2022, encompassing 779 observations from seven countries. Using a robust panel regression model, our results indicate that water disclosure positively impacts firm value. Transparent water disclosure not only enhances corporate reputation but also fulfills stakeholders' growing demand for environmental accountability. This study provides empirical evidence that companies' transparent water management enhance their market value, supporting Stakeholder Theory. We also tested the robustness of our findings using sub‐sampling, alternative measurements, and address potential endogeneity issues. Our study uniquely focuses on the specific impact of water disclosure, contrasting previous research on overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure. This research offers significant theoretical, empirical, and managerial insights into the role of environmental disclosure in business ethics and firm valuation."

Therefore, this review aimed to provide an updated summary of the literature on carbon disclosure. A total of 278 articles were selected from the Scopus database, covering the period from 2004 to 2024. Co-author and co-word analyses were conducted using VOSViewer and Bibliometrix R-Packages. The review successfully identified the most relevant authors, sources, countries, and affiliations related to carbon disclosure. It also analyzed the intellectual structure, influential journal, thematic evolution, trend topics, and selective data sources, as well as theoretical foundations in the field. Several investigations have focused on evaluating some aspects of disclosure such as its quantity and quality, determinants, as well as beneficial effects. The current review identified the most relevant topics for future surveys, including companies governance and greenwashing. Additionally, it contributed to the existing body of empirical literature by providing an updated summary and addressing the gaps and limitations in previous investigations, particularly in methodology, data acquisition, and review methods."

This study addresses this gap by employing machine learning feature analysis to identify and analyze the critical factors driving zombification, offering a fresh and data-driven perspective on the issue. Three different feature sets are examined: (i) Feature Zoo, (ii) Logistic regression-based, and (iii) Lasso-based features, focusing on critical internal characteristics of firms. These feature sets are applied to four tree-based algorithms—Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Model, and XGBoost—chosen for their white model capabilities, allowing the feature extractions. The results indicate that Debt and ROA consistently have the highest feature scores, suggesting they are crucial for predicting zombie companies. Additionally, the Lasso-based feature sets provide the best evaluation metrics, indicating that the two-step filtering process effectively improves the predictive model for zombie companies. The study enriches the literature by extending the anatomy of zombie companies with a more advanced approach. The results also address Debt and ROA as the most significant features for identifying zombie firms. Managers and policymakers should prioritize monitoring Debt and ROA as early warning indicators for company zombification."

Prior studies presented much evidence on whether environmental disclosure could reliably reflect environmental performance. However, very limited evidence has been provided on if environmental disclosure could drive firms to improve future environmental performance. Based on the competing theoretical predictions from the legitimacy theory and the “outside-in” management perspectives, this study provides new international insight into if carbon disclosure improvements could motivate future carbon performance improvement based on a change analysis. Particularly, the investigation uses a recently available carbon data set of both developed economies and developing economies from the Carbon Disclosure Project and other publicly available media platforms. We find that an improvement in carbon disclosure indicates a future carbon performance deterioration in developed economies, however, carbon disclosure changes are not related to future carbon performance changes in developing economies when using performance data from the Carbon Disclosure Project. When using performance data from other publicly available media platforms, carbon disclosure changes are not related to future carbon performance changes at all internationally. This indicates that the carbon information disclosed on other public media platforms has been intentionally beautified. Thus, firms' carbon performance changes from these platforms lose track of the prior changes in firms' carbon disclosure."

We chose to investigate how accounting professionals in India legitimise extreme work in their workplaces using exploratory qualitative research methods and applied economies of worth theoretical framework. Our findings demonstrate that senior accounting professionals with the assistance of professional associations can play an important role in mobilising professional and organisational resources to tackle extreme work in their accounting firms and the industry."

Focus group meetings with laypersons in Spain and Poland explored the impact of AI on healthcare, entertainment, education, employment and democracy. The expected changes in healthcare were perceived as most positive, whereas the impact on civil rights and democracy brought up the most fears regarding privacy, misinformation, manipulation and invasive surveillance. We conclude that digital literacy levels and trust influence heavily in the attitudes towards AI. We also suggest that media narratives should not be underestimated as a determining factor in building attitudes towards technology."

We analyse the governance self-assessment reports of the three SWFs that are signatories to the Santiago Principles and belong to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). That is, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. As SWFs grow in size and number, deepened coordination with domestic fiscal and monetary authorities will be needed. We also find that the Santiago Principles’ economic and financial targeting objective appears indifferent to the environmental and social impacts that have the potential to affect the stability of financial markets. The variation in levels of disclosure across SWFs threatens to dilute the essence of the Santiago Principles badge. Fifteen years after their formulation, the Santiago Principles show signs of needing an update to reflect emerging realities and expanded member contexts."

It introduces the Equitable Optimality economic theory, departing from materialistic views and championing a theory deeply rooted in moral economy, values, and ethics. By integrating spirituality, social justice, and ethics into economic analysis, this model contends that economics can serve the welfare of all, offering a unique lens for economic theory and policy. It challenges prevailing materialistic economic paradigms by proposing an interest-balanced/free financial economy.\n\nThis economic theory prioritises profit-sharing, societal objectives, and equitable resource allocation, aiming to create a more inclusive society. However, practical implementation and comprehensive research are crucial for understanding its impact and overcoming transitional challenges.\n\nThe Equitable Optimality economic theory provides a valuable perspective within economics, focusing on ethical foundations, acknowledging non-monetary values, and humanising economic agents. It does not aim to replace conventional economic theories but offers an alternative framework to inspire innovative approaches to economic models and policymaking. Its broader policy perspective aims to foster a more prosperous and harmonious society by integrating ethical considerations, equity and justice into economic decision-making and emphasising societal welfare."

In this paper, we develop an empirical understanding of the influence of public governance system on promoting circular economy (CE) for plastic actions among individuals. Through a survey of 1475 participants across five sub-Saharan African countries, we tested five hypotheses drawing on New Governance Theory and CE Action Recipe to explore the relationship between governance and individual's actions supporting CE for plastic. We found that a governance system that supports CE practices and exhibits governance efficiency is positively associated with individuals' actions supporting CE for plastic. The awareness of government policies, laws and regulations, institutions, processes, and programmes have a significant impact on individuals' engagement in plastic circularity practices. The paper's theoretical and governance implications highlight the relevance of public governance in shaping action towards a CE for plastic at the individual level."

Viewing stereotyping as a socially constructed practice, this study draws on a post-positivistic, reflexive epistemology in conducting 28 semi-structured interviews with accountants and related actors.\n\nFindings\nChinese accountant stereotypes are constructed and reconstructed according to the rules created and enforced in different cultural-political periods. The accountant stereotypes constructed during the ancient Confucian period (500 BC – 1948) were replaced during 1949 and 2012 when the political focus shifted towards propagating socialism and later promoting economic growth. They also show how Confucian stereotypes of accountants resurfaced in 2013 but were reconstructed by the central government's cultural confidence policy of propagating Confucianism.\n\nOriginality/value\nEmpirically, prior literature has focused on what the accountant stereotype is and how accountants respond to such stereotypes, but it has neglected the ways in which these accountant stereotypes are politically and culturally constructed, diffused and legitimated. This paper fills in the gap by understanding the social practice of accountant stereotyping in a previously unexplored political-cultural context, namely Chinese society. In theoretical terms, by offering the first use of Becker's (1963) labelling theory in the accounting literature, it furthermore enhances our understanding of how accountants' identities and social standing are shaped by social rules."

    "abstract": "Using a large panel of UK public firms, we examine the relationship between the financial risk hedging and the cost of equity capital. We hypothesize that firms utilizing financial derivative instruments reduce the stock return volatility which is priced in investors’ expectations. While financial risk hedging serves as a vehicle for firms to alleviate cash flows volatility, it also leads to economic benefits to the firm value in case of the presence of increasing asymmetric information. In addition, we hypothesize and test whether the nature of relation between financial risk hedging and cost of equity capital varies and is more negative or more ambiguous with economic shocks. Our results show that engaging in financial risk hedging enables firms to have a lower cost of capital. Consistent with the extant literature, we control for potential endogeneity problems and sample selection bias using instrumental variables and treatment effects approaches. Thus, our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity checks, including the use of multiple estimation methods and alternative proxies of cost of equity measures. Overall, our findings suggest that the value of financial hedging decisions increases during economic shocks, and if financial constraints become more severe and if cash flows volatility increases."

Further, the authors extend the literature by investigating the moderating effect of ownership concentration levels (i.e. at 5%, 10% and 20%) on the relationship between corporate governance and the cost of equity. Design/methodology/approach: The study applies several robust panel regression techniques to a sample of 114 active non-financial companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange from 2011 to 2016. Corporate governance was measured through a unique index comprising 30 governance attributes. The cost of equity was measured through the capital asset pricing model. Further, the authors construct three variables for ownership concentration levels, i.e. at 5%, 10% and 20%. To address the endogeneity problem, the one-lagged variable model and GMM approaches were also applied. Findings: The results indicate that better corporate governance reduces the cost of equity, while ownership concentration at high thresholds would increase the cost of equity. Further, the authors find that ownership concentration at the 20% threshold moderates the relationship between corporate governance and the cost of equity. Thus, the authors argue that firms can minimize the risk faced by shareholders by implementing substantive corporate governance mechanisms. In addition, effective corporate governance mechanisms at high ownership concentration levels are imperative for managing the cost of equity. Originality/value: The study reports novel evidence that ownership concentration at a high threshold moderates the effect of corporate governance on the cost of equity."

Using a very extensive dataset with 160 countries over 20 years and generating 3,200 country-year observations, this study examines the impact of ISAs adoption on the economic consequences of adopting countries. Our findings are threefold. First, we show that early ISAs adoption has positively and significantly influenced three economic indicators of the adopting countries: (i) economic growth, (ii) foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, and (iii) exchange rate. Second, our results show that late ISAs adoption has positively and significantly influenced two economic indicators: (i) exports and (ii) interest rates, but negatively with imports. Third, we find a significant positive association between ISAs adoption with amendments or translation and two economic indicators: (i) FDI and (ii) exchange rate, but negative with inflation. Finally, and by contrast, we find a negative link between early ISAs adoption, economic growth rate, and exports. Our findings have implications for theory and practice."

    "abstract": "In recognition of the need for an economic logic that complements and reinforces the ecological imperative for the circular plastic economy, this paper explores the importance and impact of digitally enabled circular plastic business models across retailing and distribution systems. The paper draws from 16 focus group discussions, complemented by 17 semi-structured interviews of frontline organisations incorporating digital innovations in their businesses to enable the management of plastic waste in Africa. The study finds that, across African countries, the transition to a circular plastic economy has been hampered by the limited uptake of circular products by consumers. In order to accelerate the transition, innovative business models are required to invigorate the ecosystem and simplify the logistics of retailing and distribution systems. The paper proposes a new conceptual framework that explicates the impact of digital innovations in the processes of value creation and value capture across a whole spectrum of circular economy reverse logistics activities: recycling, redistribution, and remanufacture. The study also highlights two important social and policy implications of digitally-enabled circular business models: Firstly, the creation of new employment opportunities through the empowerment of a new labour force for the circular plastic economy; secondly, the heightened opportunity to enact an innovative sharing economy in typically resource-constrained contexts in which otherwise idle products and resources are more efficiently used in a process of collaborative consumption."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates whether CEO–board age similarity has an impact on firms’ earnings management in M&A contexts. We argue that CEO–board age similarity may have an impact on earnings management through two main roles of the board in M&A, i.e., monitoring and advising roles. On the one hand, board–CEO age similarity may improve the quality of the board’s advice on M&A and thus reduce the CEO’s need to manipulate earnings. On the other hand, board–CEO age similarity may trigger friendship, therefore weaken the monitoring function of the board. Using the sample of all share-financed M&A deals in the UK from 2001 to 2018, we find a lower level of earnings management in firms with higher board–CEO age similarity. The evidence thus highlights the importance of the advisory role of the board in M&A. Our findings have an important contribution to the corporate governance literature and also have implications for practice."

The digital orientation was evaluated using Python-based text analysis. Surprisingly, our findings challenge conventional wisdom: Contrary to expectations, digital orientation exhibited no significant influence on firm performance metrics such as returns on assets, returns on equity and Tobin’s Q. This contradicts organizational orientation theory, suggesting that transitioning towards digitalization might not inherently enhance performance. Our study argues that adopting digitalized business practices may not ensure improved firm performance, particularly in emerging economies like Malaysia."

It aims to uncover how competition moderates this relationship and to reveal the nonlinear dynamics between digital transformation and international diversification in strategic decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach: Using a panel logistic regression analysis, this study examines data from 235 Malaysian nonfinancial listed companies from 2012 to 2019. The analysis focuses on the manufacturing and technology industries due to the availability of digital transformation data, leading to a data set of 1,180 year-firm observations. Findings: The results reveal a nonlinear relationship between digital transformation and international diversification, intensified by product market competition. Initially, digital transformation positively affects international diversification, but this effect turns negative as competition increases. Robustness checks validate these findings, indicating that competition’s impact varies with the level of digital transformation. Research limitations/implications: This study’s findings are based on text analysis as a proxy for digital transformation, which may not fully capture organizational changes. Future research could use reported transformation costs or mandatory disclosures. In addition, this study focuses solely on international diversification, excluding other forms of diversification and financial constraints. Practical implications: Policymakers should recognize that high product market competition can negate the benefits of digital transformation on internationalization. They need to balance promoting digital transformation with addressing competitive challenges. Managers should analyze the competitive landscape before pursuing international expansion, as high competition can diminish the advantages of digital transformation. Originality/value: This research enriches agency and resource-based view theories by revealing the complex dynamics between digital transformation, competition and international diversification. It introduces a parabolic relationship between competition and diversification, challenging traditional assumptions and providing a comprehensive framework for understanding strategic decisions in competitive environments."

We use robust OLS regression and two-stage least square to estimate our model, and reveal three essential findings. First, loan inclusive (the individuals with traditional loan access) has lower Fintech P2P credit than the loan exclusive (those without traditional loan access). Second, information-seeking behavior would lower the Fintech P2P credit ratio. Lastly, information-seeking significantly moderates the relationship between loan inclusion and loans from Fintech P2P lending. It implies that those loan-exclusive individuals would have less Fintech P2P credit if they have high information-seeking."

Our findings suggest that employment gains are associated with innovation, both at the aggregate level and within groups of major industries. The positive impact of technological advancement is more pronounced in the manufacturing sector. The results reveal heterogeneous patterns of the key determinants of employment growth based on the level of industries' routine intensity, but they accord well with the compensation theory concerning the connection between innovation and job creation. These results will be of interest for policymakers to design targeted economic strategies by supporting technological development in Japan and could also serve as a compass for other countries with similar workforce structures and macroeconomic characteristics."

Unlike those previous studies that took Sukuk or sharia-compliant firms, this study tests the impact of the proportion reported sharia-compliant debt financing in the balance sheet on the risk of price crash of a firm. Design/methodology/approach: Using the data from 2,752 firm-year observations of 344 Malaysian non-financial listed companies from 2012 to 2019, this article used a robust panel data estimation technique for statistical inferences. This study also employs panel GMM and quantile least squares as the robustness check. Findings: This study established a negative relationship between sharia-compliant debt financing and stock price crash risk. The robustness checks with different estimation techniques confirm the results. It implies that firms with a more significant proportion of Sharia-compliant financing tend to have lower future stock price crash risk. Practical implications: Consistent with the Islamic finance literature, the present study contributes to the existing literature on Islamic capital markets from the perspective of stock price crash risk because it is vital for risk management and investment decision-making as a measure of tail risk for stocks. The findings of this research will assist investors in developing portfolio strategies that incorporate firms with higher levels of sharia-compliant debt financing in their balance sheets. Additionally, the results of this study suggest that policymakers and regulatory bodies should consider revising their monitoring approaches for publicly listed firms. Originality/value: This study is interesting and unique, as it is a pioneer in testing the impact of sharia-compliant debt financing on reducing stock price crash risk."

We replicate the analysis using a sample of Chinese firms and find a consistent pattern. Our research advances the CEO effect literature by emphasizing the dynamic nature of the CEO effect in an international context.

However, not much is known about the operational nuances, challenges and impact cases that characterise the implementation of this national policy in such a vast, culturally diverse country as Nigeria. To address this lacuna, this study draws on qualitative data from five focus groups, crystalised with quantitative data from 151 students across four Nigerian Universities, to explicate the current trends, successes, and challenges of entrepreneurship development and innovation support in Nigerian universities. The paper offers recommendations on how the current policy on entrepreneurship education in Nigeria can be enhanced to improve student entrepreneurial aspirations and outcomes. It also signposts innovative pedagogic activities which could be deployed to achieve this."

    "abstract": "Drawing on Oliver’s typology of strategic responses (1991), this study demonstrates the strategic pressures that vulnerable local communities in Nigeria have exerted on cement companies and the multiple strategies that these companies have devised to discharge their environmental and social accountability (ESA). The data for this study were obtained through semi-structured interviews and document analysis. By exploring the role of local communities in Nigeria, our findings highlight the changing context of ESA in emerging economies in which local communities, often referred to as weak and passive stakeholders, have forced multinational companies to respond to their commitment to ESA. However, the extent to which local communities’ voices can alter companies’ profit maximisation that compromises people’s welfare and the environment has caused concern. The power and influence wielded by companies, which has enabled them to devise a multitude of strategic responses, has subtly dominated local voices and actions, confining ESA practices largely to the content of their annual statements. This raises concerns about current mechanisms for discharging ESA to promote sustainable development and attain sustainable development goals (SDGs) in emerging economies. In investigating the aforementioned, the paper also addresses the call made by prior work delineating the nexus between corporations and local communities in shaping ESA in the unique contexts of emerging economies."

Using quantile regression analysis and a large balanced panel data of 500 multinational companies operating in 40 countries from 2009 to 2019 (i.e., 5,500 firm-year observations), we uncovered the following significant associations: (i) a positive relationship between ESG disclosure and accounting performance indicators for large-sized MNEs, but this relationship is counteracted by the negative influence of the audit and sustainability committee indexes; (ii) the association between market-based performance outcomes and ESG disclosure is positively affected by the compensation, nomination, and sustainability committee indexes, while it is negatively influenced by the audit committee index; (iii) the combined board committee index has varying impacts on the connection between the components of ESG disclosure, and accounting and market-relevant performance metrics for different sizes of MNEs; and (iv) while the audit and sustainability committee indexes exert negative effects on the relationship between the components of ESG disclosure and performance measures, these effects are countered by the positive moderating impacts of the compensation and nomination committee indexes. The study concludes by discussing the policy implications of these results."

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study examines the relationship between Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices and financial distress in times of uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: Thomson Reuters ESG database, Compustat and Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) were used to derive a final sample size of 1,572 firms and 11,618 firm-year observations from 2003 to 2022. Fixed-effects regression was used to analyze the data. Findings: It was found that increasing ESG involvement leads to an increase in Z score (i.e. lower financial distress), and this impact was more profound during the COVID-19 period and also when firms' innovativeness increased. However, during the COVID-19 period, increases in capital expenditures weaken the positive effect of ESG on financial distress. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the impact of ESG performance on financial distress and the nature of this relationship during times of uncertainty such as COVID-19. Practical implications: This study offers insights to managers and practitioners when developing their corporate financial strategies, particularly financial distress management, showing the potential benefits of innovativeness and capital intensity during turbulent times similar to COVID-19. Originality/value: Little knowledge exists on how ESG engagement helps weather financial distress during periods of uncertainty due to external shocks (e.g. COVID-19). This paper looks at the effect of ESG engagement on financial distress and how capital intensity and innovativeness could influence this relationship while giving fresh insights into the impact of COVID-19."

This study first addresses the concepts of mobile payments and customer experience and then explores the current Dutch financial and banking systems, before attempting to understand the recent researches worldwide on mobile payments. Based on quantitative research methods, the study examines the factors that influence the adoption and experience of mobile payments and the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on payment methods due to social distancing rules in the Netherlands. It finds that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, safety and trust are the main factors that affect the adoption of mobile payments, and mobile-payment providers need to improve technical protection and offer some benefits to boost the mobile-payment business. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused the decline of cash payments and the increase of contactless payments in the Netherlands; mobile payments ensure people’s health and help slow down the spread of the virus."

    "abstract": "Previous studies assessing the prospects for Islamic home finance in the UK appear to be outdated, predominantly customer-oriented and lacking industry views. This study developed an up-to-date conceptual framework comprising four predicting constructs: extendibility, accessibility, affordability and authenticity, with the target construct being the prospects for Islamic home finance in the UK. The framework was assessed using a sample of 144 mortgage consultants selected through expert sampling. The findings revealed that authenticity had the greatest direct effect on prospects, followed by accessibility. In contrast, the effect of affordability on prospects was found to be insignificant. The mediation analysis showed that extendibility had a significant indirect effect on prospects via the accessibility construct. The multi-group analysis revealed no significant differences between experienced and novice mortgage consultants. Results of the post-hoc importance–performance matrix analysis (IPMA) identified authenticity as the high-priority development area, whereas the affordability of Islamic home finance was found in a low-priority zone. These results, derived from mortgage brokers, along with the combined application of PLS-SEM and IPMA, offer a more robust and industry-driven assessment of the prospects for Islamic home finance in the UK. These industry-driven and up-to-date findings provide valuable directions for policymakers and Islamic banks offering home financing in the UK and contribute new and extensive insights to the existing literature in this field."

    "abstract": "The Luckin Coffee case presents an opportunity for an important analysis of corporate governance challenges of Chinese businesses and regulators because of the 2020 scandal and the fact that it carries on business in China and is a publicly traded company in the US. In the past, company failures have led to local and sometimes global queries about the processes through which companies' objectives are set and pursued. The regulatory changes ensuing from corporate scandals can be far-reaching, controversial, and leading to global regulatory contagion. In the Luckin scandal, its real and potential implications involved two of the world's dominant economies. The concerns from the Luckin scandal are the issues on which this chapter is focused. The chapter explores the concepts and regulatory solutions that are relevant to the Luckin scandal. The dynamics of the Chinese market and the consequences of the scandal are explored in the chapter. Ultimately, the need for caution in the discourse on regulatory response to scandals such as the Luckin case is articulated in the chapter."

    "abstract": "The Chinese civilization is one of the few ancient civilizations to have survived. For thousands of years, Chinese architecture and urban planning was heavily influenced by the lessons of Confucius and the principles of Taoism. However, this age-old trend changed dramatically after the Second World War. There has always been an underlying theoretical link between the spheres of politics, urbanism, and architecture. When the Communists took power in China in 1949, one of their main objectives was to radically transform the physical, social, and economic environment of the cities. The main purpose of this study is to establish the determinants behind urban planning in China during the Cold War, between 1949 and 1991. Furthermore, we seek to identify the consequences for contemporary cities in China and other communist countries. Our study adopts a qualitative research approach involving document analysis, surveys, and field observations. The research confirms that, until 1979, elements of the Maoist Chinese city inspired urban transformations. More broadly, we identify the extent to which traditions, fashions, and political ideologies influenced the transformation of urban environments and landscapes in the People’s Republic of China. However, from 1979 onward, capitalist influences, accentuated by unprecedented migration to the cities, altered the patterns of urbanization toward development based on commercial real estate. An unfortunate effect of this recent phase of Chinese urbanization has been the destruction of traditional hutongs. Exposure to the impacts of climate change, including droughts and heat waves, will perhaps underscore the worst excesses of today’s thoughtless development practices and resurrect the fruitful aspects of the ancient wisdoms of Confucianism, Taoism, and Feng Shui.\n\nLa civilisation chinoise est une des rares civilisations anciennes qui a perduré. Depuis des millénaires, l’architecture et l’urbanisme chinois ont été très influencés par les leçons de Confucius et par les principes du taoïsme. Cependant, cette tendance ancestrale a radicalement changé après la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Il y a toujours eu un lien théorique sous-jacent entre les sphères de la politique, de l’urbanisme et de l’architecture. Quand les Communistes prirent le pouvoir en Chine en 1949, un de leurs principaux objectifs fut de transformer radicalement l’environnement physique, social et économique des villes. Ils mirent au placard le confucianisme et le taoïsme, et forgèrent de nouveaux principes et directives pour l’aménagement urbain.\nLe but principal de cette étude est de découvrir les déterminants derrière l’aménagement urbain en Chine pendant la Guerre froide, entre 1949 et 1991. En outre, nous voulons identifier les conséquences pour les villes contemporaines en Chine et dans d’autres pays communistes. Notre étude adopte une approche de recherche qualitative impliquant des analyses de documents, des enquêtes et des observations sur le terrain.\nLa recherche confirme que, jusqu’en 1979, des éléments de la ville chinoise maoïste ont inspiré les transformations urbaines. Plus largement, nous identifions dans quelle mesure les traditions, les modes et les idéologies politiques ont influencé la transformation des milieux et des paysages urbains dans la République populaire de Chine. Cependant, à partir de 1979, les influences capitalistes, accentuées par une migration vers les villes sans précédent, ont altéré les modes d’urbanisation vers un développement fondé sur l’immobilier commercial. Un effet malheureux de cette phase récente d’urbanisation chinoise fut la destruction des hutongs traditionnels. L’exposition aux impacts du changement climatique, y compris les sécheresses et les canicules, va peut-être souligner les pires excès des pratiques de développement commercial actuelles irréfléchies et ressusciter les aspects fructueux des anciennes sagesses du confucianisme, du taoïsme et du Feng Shui."

We find evidence that executive pay disparity has a significant positive relationship with abnormal returns from insider purchases preceding the good earnings news disclosures, and insider returns are greater for firms with higher earnings surprises. This implies that insiders in high CEO pay gap firms tend to exploit good earnings news to increase the profit in their stock-buying transactions. In contrast, we find a negative relationship between executive pay disparity and abnormal returns of insider sales preceding the bad earnings news disclosures. This indicates that insiders in high CEO pay gap firms are less likely to profit from their stock sales. Our empirical research also provides further evidence to the literature that insider trading is a plausible signal for future earnings of the firms."

We used the EU NFR Directive (2014/95/EU) to measure NFR. This includes environmental, corporate social responsibility, human rights, corporate board effectiveness, and corruption and bribery. Cross sectional data was collected form 89 HEIs worldwide across 15 different countries over three years. Content analysis, the weighted scoring method and panel data analysis are employed to obtain the results.Findings – Through a neo-institutional theoretical lens, this study provides a broader understanding of NFR content disclosure practices within HEIs. Our findings reveal that the audit quality, VC pay, and VC gender are significantly and positively associated with NFR content disclosure. However, board effectiveness has a significant negative impact on NFR content disclosure. More interestingly, our findings reveal that student engagement has an insignificant association with NFR content disclosure and there significant difference on the level of NFR content disclosure across universities situated in different geographical region such as USA, Australia, UK, and EU, Asia & Canada. Our findings have important implications for regulators and policymakers. Our evidence appears to be robust when controlling for possible endogeneities.Originality/value – The study contributes to the literature on corporate non-financial disclosure as it provides new insights of corporate governance mechanism and NFR disclosure within HEIs."

The various theoretical explanations for the phenomenon, alongside a survey of the empirical literature, are critically discussed. Generally, the literature results are found to be mixed and no consensus is reached. This might be attributed to different time periods, data used, proxy for the natural resource variables selected and the estimation approach employed. The practical part of this paper applies a descriptive analysis to compare economic performance among sub-regional groupings of oil-rich developed and developing countries. Our results indicated that oil-rich developing countries have underperformed in several development outcomes particularly in Middle East and North African (MENA) and Sub-Sahara African (SSA) countries. The paper also provides some suggested policies to convert the resources curse into a blessing, in particular for these countries"

    "abstract": "Turkey is strategically positioned at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is considered an important geopolitical actor in the global arena. Since Turkey embraced neoliberal economic policies in the 1980s, it has emerged as one of the leading emerging economies with major trade links with the US, Russia, EU, and Asia. Turkey has been a longstanding member of the NATO alliance and signed the European Customs Union Agreement in 1995. With the advent of Asia as the global economic powerhouse, Turkey’s foreign and economic policy horizons today extend to the Asia-Pacific Region. Turkey plays a key role in China’s Belt and Road Initiative and with the launching of the Asia Anew Initiative in late 2019, Ankara has redoubled efforts to forge closer ties with the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and with ASEAN itself. This paper will explore and evaluate Turkey’s foreign policy over the last two decades and the shift from the principle of Strategic Depth to that of Strategic Autonomy. The article will also review Turkey’s current change in international orientation and its international re-orientation toward Asia."

The main findings using a dynamic panel regression revealed a positive relationship between temperature anomalies and cash holdings. We find that firms tend to hold more cash to response the high temperature anomalies. This strategy is taken as a precautionary action to tackle climate-related risks, supporting the cash management and nature resource-based view theory. This precautionary cash will lead to underinvestment, hurting the fisheries industry growth. Thus, policymakers and corporate management must prioritize their efforts in the climate change campaign to avoid higher sea temperature anomalies."

Strategic leadership also develops, deploys and reconfigures the firm's ambidextrous capabilities (such as innovativeness, competiveness and adaptability) that influence performance. Using responses from 315 UK small- and medium-sized accountancy firms, this study empirically investigates the extent to which the direct influence of strategic leadership on performance is mediated by the firm's ambidextrous orientation. With a variance accounted for of 57.78%, the results show that ambidexterity has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between strategic leadership and the performance of accountancy firms. Also, our findings show that the perception of environmental dynamism does not influence the ambidextrous orientation of these accountancy firms. In addition, increased firm's age does not necessarily lead to decreased performance resulting from inertia."

By employing multiple linear regression and a series of cumulative logistic regression for a large sample spanning 1995-to 2014, this paper shows that countries with Anglo-Saxon culture and substantial protection rights tend to accelerate their IFRS adoption decision to maintain their legal legitimacy. This paper also indicates that countries with lower governance indicators are more prone to hasten their IFRS adoption to improve the quality of their political systems. This research reports that countries with higher educational attainment and literacy rates but lower education quality levels are more likely to hasten their IFRS adoption to enhance their education systems quality. Results indicate a positive relationship between four economic indicators (i.e., economic growth, FDI, GDP, and interest rates) and the rapid IFRS adoption speed."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the extent to which host-country institutions influence the relationship between inward foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth. We develop a theoretical model to analyse how different types of institutions condition the FDI-growth relationship and use various institutional proxies to conduct threshold estimations on panel data for 51 developed and developing countries over the period 1991-2016. Our results consistently reveal a robust, contingent effect of political stability on the FDI-growth nexus, suggesting that, among all the institutional factors considered, the absence of civil conflict or violence in the host economy is most critical in terms of yielding both direct and indirect growth-enhancing benefits associated with technology transfer and spillover effects from FDI inflows. This finding is pertinent to both developed and developing countries, although the threshold level of political stability required to achieve sizeable growth benefits from FDI tends to be lower for developing countries."

We propose a contingent approach to understanding the slack-R&D investment relationship by examining the influence of the founder's human capital and social ties, which is distinguished into political and managerial ties. Our results show that the founder’s human capital, measured by its educational level, strengthens the relationship between absorbed and unabsorbed slack resources and R&D investment. We also find that the founder’s managerial ties strengthen the relationship between resource slack and R&D intensity, whereas political ties weaken that link. Our results demonstrate the founder’s crucial role in underpinning resource utilization in newly listed firms and emphasise the importance of social ties in driving firms’ R&D activities in emerging economies."

Covid-19 containment measures generated social and economic consequences. We employ a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model to evaluate the implications on the economy. We design scenarios to mimic the containment policies via labour supply, labour productivity, government healthcare spending and remittance inflows. Results indicate that growth in\nsector output declines when compared to the no-Covid-19 baseline. However, export growth rates are predicted to be higher. Increased government healthcare spending induces expansion in the healthcare output but the sectors that produce the intermediate inputs for healthcare production do not grow in\ntandem. Household welfare declines and the loss is largest among the top quintile households in both rural and urban areas. Policymakers should revisit Uganda’s industrial policy towards domestic production of intermediate inputs to critical domestic sectors such as healthcare. Also, accelerate rural infrastructure development particularly the road network, to facilitate an integrated rural economy induced by the shift in labour and enterprise towards rural areas."

Using panel data from 2004 to 2014, we find that, while CBI does not promote financial inclusion in Africa, financial literacy and political institutions do; even to the extent of enabling CBI's impact on financial inclusion. The results are robust to different measures of political institutions from Freedom House and Polity IV Database and present implications for the role governments could play in shepherding central banks in Africa in the midst of Africa's developmental challenges and the global crises."

It focuses on how institutional entrepreneurs implement their vision of accounting change in the Islamic financial reporting standardisation initiatives while providing insights into why these actors may fail in this process. Research findings informed by semi-structured interviews and document analysis demonstrate that institutional entrepreneurs’ attainment of accounting change is subject to their ability to collectively and skilfully frame, promote and institutionalise their entrepreneurial vision, mobilise allies and alleviate the resistance of field’s “incumbents”. The paper contributes to the accounting change literature by expanding our understanding of the determinants of successful accounting change and of how institutional entrepreneurs can effect change in the contemporary accounting system. It also contributes to the ongoing institutional entrepreneurship theorisation by revealing the contingencies through which actors may overcome the barriers to change in highly institutionalised systems."

This is further strengthened by our finding that the positive effect of executive ownership on dividend tunneling is more pronounced for firms with weaker minority shareholder protection. In addition, our results show that higher degrees of state ownership may further intensify this positive association. Finally, we find that analyst coverage has a moderating effect and constrains the collusion between controlling shareholders and executives in dividend tunneling activity.\n\nTheoretical/Academic Implications\nOur study contributes to the literature on the role of managerial ownership in controlling shareholders' dividend tunneling activity. We fill a gap in the literature on the corporate agency problem by providing evidence that dividends have been employed by controlling shareholders as a means of tunneling and that executives with higher ownership are more likely to collude with controlling shareholders in dividend tunneling activities.\n\nPractitioner/Policy Implications\nThis study contributes to the debates around the promotion of the cash dividend policy in China, as our findings show that cash dividends are used as a tunneling vehicle. Providing important evidence to regulators, our findings support the argument that external monitoring by financial analysts can effectively constrain dividend tunneling by dominant shareholders, especially in the context of emerging stock markets with high ownership concentration, weak minority shareholder protection, and an underdeveloped legal system."

In the developed markets, price downtrends, lower trading volume, and higher dividend yields indicate stronger predictability. On the other hand, the cyclical and sensitive super-sectors become more predictable as liquidity goes down. Particularly in the cyclical super-sectors, smaller market capitalization and larger term spread also indicate predictability. Sector selection based on the indicators can generate economic benefits."

However, a framework that depicts the association between credit creation, financial innovation and endogenous creation of boom-bust cycles is less evident and the gap between empirical research and theoretical development remains. Hence, this study represents a first attempt to provide a framework that could explain the switch of economic cycles from virtuous to unvirtuous and vice versa. We examine the role of financial innovation and identify its “hidden soul” defined as the rate of financial innovation (RoFIN). We study RoFIN together with other structural factors, such as monopolistic financial power concentration and financial deregulation in the creation of what we identify as the wealth trap, as a potential mediating factor behind the creation of virtuous and unvirtuous cycles. A cross-country statistical exercise using the VUC indicator on the United States, United Kingdom, and Euro area economies shows the exponential effect of the rate of financial innovation over time and provides indicative evidence in support of our framework. Finally, we report that the indicator is better able to identify the unvirtuous cycle stages than the traditionally used Credit-to-GDP ratio."

This diversity applies also to their tax regime, particularly VAT. Taxes are the primary source of funding for the government and public expenditures by generating considerable revenue to fund the national product. MENA region countries, like any other country with a population that typically keeps increasing throughout time, tend to boost their economic growth to ensure higher living standards, higher real income, and innovation. This study examines the impact of important drivers of MENA countries that affects GDP growth, based on a large sample of 14 countries from 2010–2020, information collected from unit cross-sections (country), and over time. Then, panel regression is the appropriate statistical method to analyze two-dimensional data, through a fixed effect panel data analysis. The sample of countries has been chosen based on pre-established criteria reflecting the availability of data for the study period. Collected data have been analyzed using the software STATA version 17. The findings obtained prove a positive significant VAT impact on economic growth for the sample of MENA region countries. This study helps policymakers in assessing and reviewing their tax policy related to VAT to maximize their source of revenue generated by this tax. The findings of this study supported that the unemployment rate and CPI decrease GDP growth, whereas VAT leads to an increase of economic growth in this region. This proves the importance of VAT tax in raising government revenue."

Apart from location variations, there have been huge regional disparities. The study used the Harmonised Nigeria Living Standard Survey (HNLSS) applying marginal benefit incidence analysis developed as a political economy model in which different population groups such as poor and the non-poor have different political power and different costs and benefits from a given public spending. This method analysed likely benefits of additional spending across different governance levels of education in Nigeria by region (geopolitical zone) and by location (urban and rural). The study found that the marginal odds estimate for most of the regions in the south and by locations with little urban bias for primary and secondary education were pro-poor but pro-rich in the regions of the north. On the other hand, the tertiary level estimates of education were decidedly pro-rich at the margin in all regions and by location.

We collect 319 articles, and reviews on Waqf extracted from the Scopus database, covering a period exceeding 100 years from 1914 until June 2020. We employ RStudio, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel for citation analysis, content, and network analyses. A systematic review of recent publications complemented the bibliometric analysis. Alongside revealing the most relevant scientific actors in waqf literature, most researchers on Waqf were from Malaysia; they conducted studies widely on cash Waqf. As a result, we identify four research themes for waqf studies which include (1) Cash Waqf endowment, (2) Islamic accountability and Waqf, (3) Waqf and Islamic social finance, and (4) Governance for Waqf endowment. This is the first study to provide a bibliometric review of waqf literature to address gaps in the existing research and offer directions for future research which could benefit early-career Islamic finance researchers."

The rising cases of financial mismanagement, which was associated with the financial management behavior of top administrators in these SOEs, prompted this study. It is believed that identifying the factors that determine the financial management behavior of these administrators would help to find solutions to the problem. Based on the multistage sampling technique, 385 top administrators from the SOEs at the federal level in Nigeria participated in the survey. Quantitative analysis was used to analyze the data and the results show that income, family size, and financial literacy are the most important factors affecting the financial management behavior of the administrators. It is recommended that there should be an improvement in income and other working conditions of the administrators in the SOEs since income has been confirmed to be an important shift factor of financial management behavior. In the same vein, given the role of family size, it is recommended that efforts on population reduction should be intensified. Finally, financial literacy should be given priority in checkmating irresponsible financial management behavior."

The extremely large-scale drawdown across the markets signifies an indiscriminate impact. To some extent, Asian Islamic markets show relative resilience to their counterparts. Both Islamic and non-Islamic Asian markets signpost a quicker recovery than the rest of the regions, the Middle East & Africa, Europe, and America. It appears that a higher return leads to a smaller maximum drawdown, while higher volatility leads to a larger maximum drawdown. Despite the large-scale drawdown, a number of markets secure a positive return where Islamic markets outperform the counterparts. Conventional markets respond to the COVID-19 aftershock homogenously as a result of their high interlinkages. Collectively, these results reinforce the view that in the crisis period, Islamic markets are more resilient."

Using a sample of the FTSE All-Share Index firms listed on the London Stock Exchange for the period 2009 to 2018 and the ordinary least squares regression (OLS) estimation method, we find that cost of debt is higher for firms with CEOs in their early tenure in office than those in their later tenure in office. Further analysis shows that board independence attributes including (1) the proportion of independent directors on the board, (2) full (100%) independent audit committee members, and (3) a lead independent director representation on the board interact with CEO early tenure in office to reduce cost of debt due to the board’s effective monitoring ability when the CEO is new and risk-seeking. Our study extends CEO tenure and corporate outcomes in general and in particular CEO risk-taking incentives and cost of debt literature, and has important implications for firms seeking to raise finance from the debt market when their CEO is new as well as identifying the control mechanisms that they need to put in place to lower the cost of debt."

    "abstract": "Within the context of a target oil price band regime, this paper posits that cheating behaviour in OPEC has ethical and accountability implications for the organisation. It also impacts on its reputation and ability to ensure stable and fair oil prices in the oil markets. Based on datasets covering the period from 2000 to 2012 (i.e. production quota era), analysed using the vector autoregression/vector error correction (VAR-VEC) framework, the study’s results indicate that OPEC cheating, mainly instigated by the amount of spare production capacity available to OPEC members, does not seem to have a significant direct effect on international oil prices. However, the degree of cheating by OPEC member-states might disrupt its ability to maintain surplus capacity enough to reduce price speculation in the oil markets. Should cheating behaviour in OPEC continue unabated, this could jeopardise an effective energy regulatory framework and market transparency. The paper, therefore, recommends a policy action in OPEC to support the redesigning of the existing quota system that is fair and just to its members and capable of controlling any cheating behaviour."

Data were gathered from interviews, document analysis and participant observation. The study has identified three processes of acquiring accounting information informally; attachment to managers, hearing the same information repeatedly and participation in goal-driven activities. Interdependency between the clinicians and accountants and their shared version have been the two key factors in clinical commissioning groups (CCG) facilitating the informal learning process."

    "abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to examine the compliance status of Islamic banks in Bangladesh with Shari’ah-based accounting standards named Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) standard-4 and its association with corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach: The six years of secondary data, including the annual reports of 2013–2018, were collected from the websites of all the seven listed Islamic banks, i.e. 100% of the population available during the period of study. The study used a content analysis approach for systematically categorizing and analysing the contents disclosed in the annual report. A total compliance score based on 133 reporting items of IFSB standard-4 were considered for content analysis. Furthermore, this study applied the ordinary least square to investigate the impact of corporate governance on IFSB standard-4. Findings: This study found that the level of compliance with the IFSB standard by the Islamic banks in Bangladesh is poor, as the overall compliance status is 44.83%. Further, this study observed a significant and positive influence of the Shari’ah supervisory committee, the board size, accounting experts on the board, foreign ownership and institutional ownership on the level of compliance with IFSB standard-4. On the other hand, this study found a negative effect of directors’ ownership on the level of compliance with IFSB standard-4. Practical implications: This study provides the management of Islamic banks an insight into developing their governance characteristics to comply with Islamic accounting and reporting standards. Moreover, this study expects to facilitate the management of Islamic banks in designing their accounting and reporting outlines to enhance the level of compliance with the IFSB standards. Originality/value: This pioneering study on IFSB standards opens an avenue to the researchers exploring the accounting and reporting status of Islamic banks considering the requirements of the IFSB standards."

We use a newly developed panel data model of stochastic frontier analysis that endogenizes cost efficiency. The dataset consists of 1,673 firms from ten provinces in Vietnam over three years: 2009, 2011 and 2013. Our results suggest that CSR can enhance cost efficiency of firms. This positive effect of CSR on efficiency can be masked if cost efficiency is treated\nas exogenous or endogeneity is not handled appropriately. The upshot is that our results challenge the widely held view of the existence of a trade-off between CSR and firm efficiency."

Using data for 50 firms spanning 2008-2017, our study reports that the environmental performance has positively influenced the stock price of both the product and service-based firms listed on LSE. Similarly, it enhanced the return on capital for product-based firms while reducing them for service-based firms. In contrast, social activities have a significant negative impact on the stock price of the product and service-based listed firms. Likewise, social performance has a significant negative impact on the return on capital of service-based firms listed on LSE. However, we find an insignificant relationship between governance disclosure and the stock price and the return on capital for product and service-based firms. This study has implications for policymakers of stock markets to issue rigid regulations to enforce all listed firms to disclose their environmental activities to stakeholders."

We have used various databases, including Bankscope, World Bank, and Transparency International, to gather Bank-specific and macro-economic data for 77 banks covering the period 2005–2014. We perform ordinary least square (OLS) and generalised methods of moments regression (GMM) using a balanced panel and find (1) Islamic banks as less efficient and stable as compared to conventional banks in the GCC region, (2) corruption has a negative (positive) impact on Islamic (conventional) banks' stability. Our findings provide support for the ‘sand the wheel’ hypothesis of corruption for Islamic banks. This finding supports the view that under the current weak governance structures and complex policy framework, corruption acts as an ‘escape hatch’ for conventional banks. Our empirical findings could pave the way for further policy reform for the banking sector in the GCC region."

This article develops a readily applicable econometric method for delineation that considers functional aspects of cities and their surroundings. We perform delineation analysis using the data for 78 Polish core cities, grouping them by population size. Using the satellite data on lights emitted at night, population density, commuter numbers as well as the number of houses and apartments built in each commune, we apply a threshold regression model to determine the boundaries of functional urban areas. Our main results suggest that the mean radius of functional urban areas (FUAs) around the largest (most populous) cities is, on average, 21 km, while it is between 13 and 16 km for smaller cities. We then test how the econometric results compare with the perceptions of local inhabitants through a citizen science project (CSP) conducted as a robustness check."

Using a cross-section of 21,954 firms from 47 African countries, the study estimates several multivariate models to examine the factors that are associated with the decision of firms to register at the start of their operation and the length of time to remain unregistered. The findings show that entrepreneurship in the informal sector is complex and context-bound as contextual factors unique to Africa, such as, corruption, political instability, crime rate, infrastructure (electricity and transportation), access to land and finance, influence the entrepreneur’s decision to register their firm at the start of its operation. The length of time firms remain unregistered is shown to be positively correlated to access to finance and infrastructural availability and negatively related to crime and political instability. These results vary based on the size of the business with larger businesses being impacted less by these variables."

Using data for 162 countries over 1995–2014 (i.e., 3240 observations) and drawing on distinctive insights from diffusion theory, we found that common law countries tend to adopt ISAs faster than civil law countries. Our findings also show that vigorous legal enforcement and shareholder protection regimes promote the early adoption of ISAs, whereas robust judicial efficiency systems constrain the early adoption of ISAs. In addition, our results show that higher literacy rates and educational attainment simulate the earlier diffusion of ISAs. We also find that higher levels of individualism and uncertainty avoidance, but low levels of power distance cultural values, boost the early adoption of ISAs. Finally, our results report that countries with strong political stability and control of corruption tend to adopt ISAs faster than those with solid government effectiveness."

More specifically, we test whether family firms pay higher dividend compared to counter non-family firms in Bangladesh. We argue that family firms are more likely to pay higher dividend to display lower agency problems between controlling family and minority shareholders. Using 993 firm-year observations from 2011-2019, we find that, consistent with our arguments, family firms distribute higher dividend compared to non-family firms to mitigate expropriation concern of non-controlling shareholders. This study contributes to family business literature and provides policy implications in the sense that regulators understand the importance of ownership structure and how it affects firms’ dividend payout policy that serves shareholders’ interests."

Furthermore, a supplementary test confirms that government ownership has also a positive impact on board monitoring intensity, as measured by the frequency of board meetings. This study injects the literature with fresh evidence on the role of state ownership in R&D investment in China, especially after the most recent wave of privatization, namely Split-Share Structure Reform (SSSR) which started in 2005. The results of this study have implications for different stakeholders as they do not support the common impression regarding the negative impact of state ownership on business outcomes."

Using a fixed-effect model on 2,260 companies’ annual data from 2012 to 2017, we analyze whether female board members influence CSR performance. The results indicate that the proportion of female board directors (PFBD) in Chinese firms is relatively small compared with the male. In other words, the boards members are predominantly male. The fixed effects model indicates that both the number and proportion of female directors are significant in influencing CSR performance. Surprisingly, we note that the average age of female board directors has a significant and negative impact on CSR performance. The results also indicate that the education level of the female director does play a significant role in CSR performance. This demonstrates that firms need to recruit educated board directors and with a right mix of age."

In contrast, the novel approach introduced in this study constructs a topographical map demarcating the relative importance, dispersion, and interrelationship among many finance topics. The final product is a bird’s eye view of the whole literature illustrating historical trends, concentrations, and territories. We apply qualitative analysis, purposive sampling, and syntactic analysis to 34,261 articles published in 52 journals over the past two decades. First, we analyze the proliferation and historical development of topics. We find that a few topics (e.g., insurance) are losing ground to newer ones (e.g., blockchain and digital currency). However, several topics seem to occupy a stable, sizeable portion of finance literature (e.g., investment strategies and portfolio management). Next, we analyze the relationship between topics and journals and report strong tendencies that are not always confined by the traditional scope of journals. For instance, papers addressing investment strategy and portfolio management issues seem to appear in numerous journals; while special topics such as blockchain, digital currencies, dividends, and real estate can only be found in a limited number of journals. We also report strong interdependence among topics. More than a third of the papers screened in this study discuss two topics or more. We identify a list of topics that are likely to be investigated jointly. Overall, our work demonstrates the historical evolution of the entire finance literature; and identifies fertile areas for future research."

The empirical evidence confirms contagion effects in some individual markets. However, significant evidence of contagion is found only during the global financial crisis from the regional perspective. Our findings suggest that the regional impacts of crises differ due to the nature of those crises. We also find financial contagion increases in the country-level risk, market capitalization and export to GDP and decreases in corruption."

We posit that FinTech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion. We invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality. We uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which FinTech reduces income inequality. We also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries. Overall, our results support the aspirations of the UN-2030-ASD and G20-HLP-DFI. Highlights Harnessing the potential of FinTech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality has been proposed by the UN and G20. We posit that FinTech affects income inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion. We invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether the effects of FinTech differ across countries with different levels of income inequality. We find that financial inclusion is a key channel through which FinTech reduces income inequality, at all quantile levels, primarily among higher-income countries."

Leveraging a unique sample of 428 small and medium-sized firms listed on the Growth Enterprise Market in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange between 2009 and 2016, we find that the foreign ownership’s contribution to productivity is not linear and varies across different quantiles of the productivity distribution. Our findings also show that the founder’s education and foreign experience strengthen the foreign ownership - productivity link, while the founder’s political and managerial ties weaken it. Our results reveal the strategic importance of the founder and contribute to an improved understanding of why firms vary in their ability to enhance productivity in emerging economies."

    "abstract": "There seems to be crisis in education and research.  The education landscape looks fragmented, expensive and yet fails millions.  A common perception is that, armed with cultural and social capital, the ‘sharp elbows of the middle classes’ game a commodified system to amass credentials. The media rails against learning institutions that inflate grades to cover up failings.  Some academics game the system or churn out indigestible papers of negligible practical social impact.  In an effort to unravel some of these issues and sketch the future of education and research, the study conducted a preliminary exploratory thematic investigation.  First, it chose six credible institutions in the field.  A brief review of associated web content chose prominent ‘sound bites’. In Phase II, the author identified relevant journal articles, initially using the search term <Future education research>.  Rather than structured or systematic, the review was focused.  Finally, in Phase III, the inquiry creatively and interactively grouped the collected secondary martial into themes, underpinned by reflection on decades of embedded teaching experience in a dozen schools or colleges and seven universities.  The convenience sampling and judgemental analysis generated ten themes from recent seminal discourse on the future of education and research: TENSION PARADOX,ECOSYSTEM ENRICHMENT, PHRONESIS vs. COMMODIFICATION, ACCESS vs. ELITECREDENTIALISATION, STRATEGIC COLLABORATION, NURTURING EMOTIONAL & SOCIALWELLBEING, FUNDING/RECONFIGURING CAPITALISM, JUDICIOUS TECHNOLOGY, INVESTMENTIN PEOPLE, DEMOCRATISING DIALOGUE.  The most salient dimensions were PHRONESIS vs. COMMODIFICATION and STRATEGICCOLLABORATION.  In effect, much recent managerialist educational reform (notwithstanding its transformative gloss)seems, actually, fundamentally misguided. Second, impactful research in, for example, deep tech, resilience or health calls for strategic interdisciplinary collaboration."

Using a bivariate probit model, the role of female corporate leaders in financial statement fraud commission and detection is examined for Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2018. The representation of female corporate leaders increases the likelihood of fraud detection, thus reducing firms’ propensity to engage in fraud. The finding confirms that women are risk averse and more committed to ethical practices than men in corporate leadership positions. Moreover, this impact of gender diversity is contingent upon the nature of ultimate controllers of listed companies: more female representation in top leadership roles can mitigate fraud commission or detect fraud effectively in non-state-owned enterprises, but not in state-owned enterprises. In addition, the recent anti-corruption campaign initiated by Chinese President Jinping Xi is a powerful form of public governance. Female corporate leaders play a more positive role in mitigating fraud commission and detecting fraud commission in the post-campaign period than in the pre-campaign period."

Human capital enhances the positive impact of dejure CBI on financial development in countries with higher literacy rates and worsens the negative impact of de facto CBO on financial development. Independent central banks can be made more effective in achieving financial development targets through governments improving literacy rates.

Using a self-constructed segment reporting quality measure and a sample of 884 firm-year observations over the period of 2007 to 2011, we provide evidence that investors and lending institutions find no change in the usefulness of segment reporting after the adoption of IFRS 8. Our study is original in using a comprehensive measure of segment reporting quality. Furthermore, our study is the first to examine the relationship between segment reporting quality and the cost of debt capital after the adoption of IFRS 8 and the moderating role of the country-level enforcement system.

    "abstract": "This thesis discusses how clinicians align their logic with the objective of the organisation that they work for, leading to informal acquisition of accounting literacy and the use of accounting information. The study uses institutional logic theory to explain the transformation that takes place as clinicians work alongside accountants. Data were gathered from document analysis, participant observation and semi-structured interviews with GPs, nurses and pharmacists.\nDrawing on institutional logic theory, the study argues that the objectives that clinicians intend to achieve when they join the management team differ from those of the organisation. However, as they learn about the organisation’s specificities such as its politics, budgetary process, and public expectations, their perceptions of what is possible align with those of the organisation.\nThe alignment of these diverse types of logic manifests in the form of trust, minimal conflict and a shared vision, even though the different groups are not necessarily in agreement about the best way to rationalise services. Consequently, the different groups can work together in harmony and allow some actors to direct certain activities while other actors shape different activities but decisions must be justified with sufficient information.\nThe alignment of logic and teamwork fosters informal learning through three processes: attachment to managers; hearing the same information repeatedly; and participation in goal-driven activities. Interdependency between clinicians and accountants and their shared visions are the two key factors in facilitating the informal learning process. The knowledge acquired is then used in decision-making, to influence behaviour, and for the purposes of education and negotiation."

In the first, we track the relevance of monetary policy decisions originating in developed economies for interbank funding liquidity risk in BRICS economies during crisis periods by applying a time-varying parameter model in a Bayesian framework. The results indicate weak associations between interbank credit market and monetary policy and market conditions in the US. In contrast, the Federal Reserve's National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) — a representative of the health of both real and financial sectors in the US — matters more. The temporal patterns of the results imply that key central banking decisions precede or coincide with low degrees of associations. In the second, we examine whether interbank credit crunch exerts an influence on market liquidity risk in BRICS economies using a Granger causality approach. The results reveal that interbank credit crunch depresses market liquidity in the corresponding domestic market and that the state of fear and credit market conditions in the US exert some influence in this regard. Overall, our findings hint at judicious market intervention and liquidity management by BRICS central banks."

We use a sample of UK firms for the period 2009 to 2016 and find that firms audited by female auditors do not resort to a higher level real activities manipulation when their ability to engage in accruals management is constrained. Overall, our results suggest that the benefits of hiring female auditors (i.e. less accrual-based earnings management) are overwhelmingly higher than the costs they might bring to the client firms (i.e. higher real activities manipulation)."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Kuala Lumpur (KL) emerged as the capital of the newly independent Federation of Malayan States in 1957 with a population of 316,000. Over the next 60 years, the city expanded into a major urban regional conurbation. It now covers an area of 2,790 km 2 and has a population of around 7.7 million. In the last two decades, market-driven, fast-track development, underpinned by road infrastructure has accelerated the city's urban transformation. Especially over the last two decades, a spate of urban redevelopments, including commercial and retail complexes, specialised centres, industrial parks, educational complexes and residential estates have transformed the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Region (KLMR) beyond recognition. KL is only one example among many of intensive Southeast Asian property-led urban development, fuelled by demographic pressures and global capital inflows that transformed the regional natural and built environments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of globalisation, neoliberalism and property-led development, on the built form and socio-cultural legacies of the KLMR. Design/methodology/approach: The major aim of this study is to determine how neoliberalism and property-led development have impacted the urban form and structure of the KLMR. The methodology applied in this study concentrates mainly on the use of qualitative research methods. The major qualitative research methods include qualitative analysis, field surveys and observations, primary and secondary data collection. The approach in this study is to exemplify the shift from government-sponsored development in the post-independence period to the current globalised-private oriented development. Findings: The major findings of this research suggest that the global, property-led mode of urban development, whilst superficially successful, undermined traditional and tropical-climate urban landscapes. It also bequeathed many urban or property level problems, including traffic congestion, air pollution, planning governance and building management issues. The paper outlines narratives for a more balanced and sustainable mode of urban development, which is more in tune with local culture and climatic conditions. Originality/value: This paper provides a deep insight analysis and evaluation of KL's growth from a small town into a global metropolitan region where property-led development dictates the rules and determines the character of the city."

Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) were fields developed from approximately the 1950s and have presented important applications, especially in the last three decades. Nevertheless, applications in accounting and finance have not developed accordingly, and a comprehensive framework is missing in the existing literature. This paper examines how NLP and IR can facilitate reporting and disclosure, both Financial and Non-Financial. The paper provides a brief literature review on NLP/IR applications in accounting and finance. It better informs and expands on the discussion of NLP/IR applications in academic research, professional organisations (i.e., IFRS), and industry. It explores some innovative applications of NLP/IR in unstructured data and its use in reporting and disclosure and FinTech applications. The main contribution is the definition of a complete framework that consistently analyses the possible NLP/IR applications in the accounting processes. We find that there can be many more applications of NLP/IR in accounting and finance and suggest future directions for research."

The analysis is conducted using a sample of non-financial firms listed in eleven European countries between 2006 and 2017. We find a positive association between non-executive employee ownership and financial reporting quality. Furthermore, we find this positive association to be more pronounced for firms operating in the following settings: higher labour union density, more industry peer firms and more flexible labour market regulations. Overall, these findings support the view that employee shareholding enhances the quality of financial reporting by aligning the interests of employees with those of shareholders through two channels: reduced agency problems and enhanced employee retention. Our study contributes to the research on the impact of ownership characteristics on financial reporting incentives. It underscores the role non-executive employee ownership can play in improving a firm’s corporate governance and therefore the quality of financial reporting."

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that oil booms induce wealth effects that cause appreciation of the domestic currency, which harms the competitive manufacturing sector exports. This has been named the \"Dutch disease\" and has been examined in many studies; however, very limited attention has been paid to the impact of Dutch disease on manufacturing sub-sectors. This paper examines the impact of an oil boom on manufacturing sub-sectors in oil-rich developed and developing countries. It assesses the oil boom effect on medium-high technology exports in a panel data sample of 39 oil-rich countries for the period 1990–2015. It also investigates the effect of an oil boom on high-technology exports in a panel data sample of 31 oil-rich countries for the period 1990–2016. We employ the panel data fixed effect with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors approach to tackle several panel data problems that are normally present in such analyses: heteroscedasticity, serial correlation, and cross-sectional dependence. Using real oil revenue and oil production as a proxy for the oil boom, the results of the study show that an oil boom significantly reduces medium-high technology exports and high-technology exports at the global level of oil-rich developed and developing countries. These results confirm the presence of the resource movement effect of the Dutch disease, which hinders economic growth and development. When the full sample is split into regional groupings, these results are observed in Middle Eastern and African countries, Asian and Pacific countries, and European and North American countries, suggesting that these countries are also affected by the Dutch disease. However, Latin American countries produce opposite results. An oil boom significantly increases both medium-high- and high-technology exports, contradicting the Dutch disease argument. The results of this study suggest that policy makers in countries experiencing the Dutch disease problem should improve institutional quality, develop human capital, promote economic diversification, and enhance investment in manufacturing sub-sectors. They should also minimize the appreciation of the real exchange rate, attract FDI in the manufacturing sector, and reduce the cost of doing business. This will help them to utilize oil wealth more effectively and efficiently, enhancing economic growth and development, therefore avoiding the Dutch disease problem"

We show that target firms listed both in the secondary market of the UK, known as the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), and in the traditionally regulated Main Market, experience significant abnormal stock returns prior to takeover announcements. These results persist after controlling for market anticipation, indicating signs of information leakage. Contrary to the narrative that secondary markets may be more susceptible to market abusive behaviors, we find that the AIM targets experience significantly lower pre-announcement returns. In addition, we do not find support that the introduction of stricter laws reduces the price run-ups in any of the two markets. In sharp contrast, we find support that the enforcement of insider trading laws, through criminal convictions, reduces the pre-announcement abnormal stock returns but only in the market in which the enforcement focuses."

    "abstract": "The energy sector is facing increasing risks, mainly concerning fraudulent activities and cyberattacks. This paradigm shift in risks would require innovative solutions. This paper proposes an innovative architecture based on Distributed Ledger Technologies (Blockchain) and Triple Entry Accounting (X-Accounting). The proposed architecture focusing on new applications of payment and billing would improve accountability and compliance as well as security and reliability. Future research can extend this architecture to other energy technologies and systems like EMS/SCADA and associated applications."

    "abstract": "The United Nations labelled climate change as one of the greatest challenges of all time. The least developed countries could suffer more from the adverse impact of climate change and require financial support from the advanced economies to combat such a global challenge. However, advanced economies are falling short of their pledges to provide financial support to emerging economies under Paris Agreement. Therefore, this study explores the environmental performance of firms listed in the US stock market to explore the current trends in environmental performance. We explore the environmental performance of US-listed non-financial firms under the theoretical lens of Maqasid Shariah. Maqasid Shariah has environmental sustainability embedded within its core values and could guide firms to become more environmentally friendly. This study collects secondary data from REFINITIV databases for four hundred eighty-one non-financial firms listed on the US stock exchange. This study covers a period of five years (2017–2021) and uses an unbalanced panel with 1860 observations. The least-square dummy variable results confirm that Shari'ah-compliant firms have better environmental performance. Such results hold after endogeneity corrected regression. The study findings have practical implications for regulators and promote the role of ethical business models toward mitigating the challenges of climate change. This is unique as it presents empirical evidence of the positive association between Shari'ah compliance and environmental performance in the context of an advanced economy."

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to explore the complex, multi-level institutional dynamics of smart city reforms and projects and their potential sustainability pressures on the implementation of a management accounting system in an Egyptian state-owned enterprise (SOE), which has a politically sensitive institutional character. Design/methodology/approach: This study adds to institutional management accounting research using a multi-level perspective of institutional dynamics in the smart city context. Data were collected from an interpretive case study of an Egyptian SOE that was under socio-political sustainability pressures to implement a smart electricity network project in New Minya city. Findings: Smart city projects have formed social and political sustainability pressures, which introduced the enterprise resource planning (ERP) network as a new management accounting system. A new (complex and multi-level) management accounting system was invented to reinvent the sustainable city as an “accounting city” (which appeared rhetorically as a “smart city”). “Smart” being the visibility and measurability of the sustainability performance of the collective body, which calls the city and its connectivity to different institutional levels brought out in a city network project for the ERP-enabled electricity distribution. Research limitations/implications: This study examines a single case study from a single smart city and identifies the accounting community’s need for multiple and comparative case studies to further analyse the potential impact of smart city reforms and projects on the sustainable implementation of management accounting systems. Practical implications: City policymakers and managers may benefit from the practical findings of this interpretive field-based case study in planning, implementing and monitoring smart city projects and objectives. Social implications: Individual and collective well-being may be enhanced through new management accounting forms of multi-level local governance and increased political, field and organisational sustainability. Originality/value: This study provides important insights into the sustainability dynamics of management accounting in achieving smart city reforms. The achievement of sustainability management accounting systems has connected to multiple ERP roles at different institutional levels, which resulted in accommodating the socio-political objectives of smart city projects."

In addition to the stimulus packages to adjust the economic shock from COVID-19, regulators around the world are searching for innovative mechanisms to rebuild the economy. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of SRI Sukuk to serve as an Islamic social finance solution for development projects to mitigate the adverse economic effects of COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a mixed-method research framework. The authors use a systematic literature review following the recommendations of Bowen (2009) to identify critical challenges financing PPP projects using SRI Sukuk. In the next phase, the authors interview participants involved in an SRI Sukuk financed PPP project to get more significant insights on the challenges identified through the literature review process. Findings: The authors identify the need for greater transparency for SRI financed PPP projects. Also, organisational and legislative challenges are limiting the attractiveness of SRI Sukuk as a financing mechanisms for post-COVID development projects. Practical implications: SRI Sukuk is an emerging financing concept, and the use of such an Islamic financial instrument in financing development projects can serve as a viable alternative for policymakers in a post-COVID economic environment. Social implications: The successful completion of the development projects integrating the concept of Social Maslahah through SRI Sukuk in Malaysia could encourage other emerging economies to use such innovative Islamic financial instrument for economic development in post-COVID environment. Originality/value: This paper is unique, as it provides evidence on the potential of SRI Sukuk to finance large scale public-private partnership projects."

    "abstract": "Currently, the implementation of sustainability accounting and reporting (SAR) is fragmented. Yet, if the world is to tackle climate and pollution crises, it needs to urgently transition away from fossil fuel and plastic configurations to more sustainable ones. This transformative journey will involve accounting reforms to enrich stakeholder information re the environmental impact of an organisation’s activities. The special issue hosts papers that bridge environmental and accounting disciplines that analyzes and reflects on entity sustainability performance reporting. There are opposing views on SAR reform pathways. Experts dispute the notion of ‘materiality’ or significant reporting impacts. Anglo-Saxon accounting bodies tend to be traditional and investor-minded. They advocate for a single financial materiality focus and prudent, incremental reporting system reform. Global and European institutions (UN, EU, GRI) seek to broaden materiality beyond financial impacts. Their alternative ‘double materiality’ preference considers a broader spectrum of stakeholders compared to traditional, conventional accounting and reporting systems. Both the traditional single and broader double accounting reform perspectives have theoretical as well as pragmatic advantages and disadvantages. Although the standard setting landscape is evolving, division, paradox and contention remain. Notwithstanding sustainability accounting and reporting contention, climatic and ecological challenges impel urgent resolution.\n\nAnthropogenic and industrial pressures accelerate emission-intensive construction activity, responsible for 38% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Within decades, climate change could dent global GDP by 11–14%. Within the next seventy years, sea levels are likely to rise by 1m. In a worst-case scenario, if all of Greenland’s ice sheet were to melt or other tipping points reached, the rise could be as much as 7m. Worryingly, the seemingly inexorable increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations intimates we are drifting towards such a doomsday scenario. Whilst in the 1970s, the annual increase in this GHG was 1 ppm; it now exceeds 2.4 ppm per year. Conventional economic and accounting performance metrics, because they tend to ignore either environmental or social considerations, may be necessary but are insufficient entity or project performance indicators. They simply ignore the external costs of many construction, industrial or agricultural activities. Notable external costs include ecosystem depletion or habitat loss, plastic contamination, air and water pollution. Since the 1950’s, the annual world output of plastic has increased almost 200 times from 2 to over 380 million tonnes of which 8-12 million tonnes is washed into the sea (2-3%). The mismanaged disposal of plastic waste, mainly from lower income countries with weak disposal infrastructure (notably India, Bangladesh and the Philippines), causes marine plastic pollution that threatens the safety of global fish stocks. The climate crisis, contamination and pollution impel urgent accounting systems reform.\n\nThe special issue critically assesses the state of sustainability accounting and reporting today across a range of sectors. It disseminates research that influences policy and practice for a green economic transition. We particularly welcome international, cross-disciplinary articles on business sustainability that integrate financial with environmental considerations, involving:\n• Green investment evaluation\n• Measuring climate change mitigation impacts\n• Integrated variance analysis for environmental improvement\n• Reporting on performance improvement in, for example, energy mix, air pollution, toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes\n• Assessing ecosystems impacts (e.g. water pollution, biodiversity)\n• Evaluating land use impacts\n• Assessing community health-related impacts of firm practices or outputs\n• Evaluation of unsustainable production or consumption\n\nSuggest themes:\n• Multi-criteria project evaluations\n• Sustainable performance management\n• Sustainable cost and full-cost accounting\n• Triple bottom line (TBL) accounting\n• Natural capital inventory accounting\n• Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n• Materiality and precautionary principle\n• Risk assessment, green investment due diligence and assessment\n\nIn this Special Issue, original research articles and reviews are welcome. Research areas may include (but not limited to) the following:\n• International, cross-disciplinary articles on sustainability that integrate financial with environmental considerations\n• Integrated performance management and reporting (triple bottom line, balanced scorecard etc.)\n• Assessment of firm green credentials and environmental reporting\n• Project multi-criteria evaluation\n• Sustainability accounting standards and reforms to accounting standards\n\nWe look forward to receiving your contributions."

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the failure of the traditional Ricardo–Haberlerian (1817; 1936) theory of comparative advantage (RTCA) in a strategic market game à la Shapley–Shubik (1977). In this model, trade is driven, not by comparative advantages, but by strategic considerations. We prove, in a Ricardian\nframework, the simultaneous existence of two types of equilibria, at both of which active international trade takes place. In the first type of equilibrium, both countries specialise based on comparative advantages. In the other, each country produces only its comparative-disadvantage good. The welfare properties, and policy implications of this result (using the examples of the China–US trade war and Venezuela), are discussed at length in two dedicated sections. We show that the predictions of the RTCA depend, not on the number of agents in the economy, but on the nature of agents: the RTCA fails to obtain even with an infinite number of large players in each country. We prove that the RTCA prevails when agents are price-takers, and establish the conditions under which equilibria of our market game coincide with Walrasian ones."

This article explores the causes of this dissatisfaction by analysing students' past feedback experiences pre-university and how these relate to their expectations regarding feedback at the Higher Education level. This study is based on a large survey undertaken at a UK Business School at the beginning of course induction meetings for 1st year undergraduate students. The results reveal that there is a significant misalignment between students' university feedback expectations and actual university feedback. These findings highlight the importance of managing student expectations regarding the nature and timeliness of feedback. This paper offers suggestions for feedback design and managing students' feedback expectations for course leaders to facilitate students' transition from schools and colleges to UK universities.\nSupplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43545-022-00313-y."

    "abstract": "Every year the global financial system sends trillions of dollars to finance environmental destruction, but the climate crisis forces change. Notwithstanding vested interests and the unrecognised paradox of adopting environmental business strategies, the implementation of sustainability accounting and reporting (SAR) is imperative to catalyse economic transition away from fossil-fuel and plastic configurations to more sustainable ones. The research proceeded sequentially. First, it scanned the backdrop to the SAR problem and identified key associated institutions and a corpus of recent literature. An initial review to disentangle its conflicting threads generated three themes of ‘climate crisis’ and ‘conservative’ or more ‘radical’ SAR reform paradigms. Iteratively harnessing this thematic lens, the investigation re-examined the SAR literature corpus. It detected fragmented SAR responses to the climate crisis. Accordingly, the research reformulated its first theme to ‘dystopic climate crisis fragmentation’ but only refined the other two conservative or radical themes to take account of materiality and the split between Anglo-Saxon (IFRS, SSAB) or global and continental institutions (UN, EU, GRI). Conservatives defend incremental standard improvements but retain a single materiality investor-focus. Radicals seek to implement double materiality with a broader spectrum of stakeholders in mind. Both approaches have theoretical as well as pragmatic advantages and disadvantages, so the SAR contention rumbles on. Whilst the standard setting landscape is evolving, division, paradox and contention remain. Given vested interests in the destructive status quo, it would be naïve to expect a harmonious SAR Ithaca to emerge anytime soon. Yet the challenges impel urgent action."

First, we found a positive association between late mandatory IFRS adoption and stock market integration in Europe. Second, our findings indicate a significant negative association between early IFRS adoption and the following financial indicators: stock market trading volumes, stock market capitalization, market turnover, and market return. Third, our study reveals an insignificant association between early IFRS adoption and stock price volatility alongside stock market development. Our findings are robust and have significant practical and policy implications for regulators and policymakers of multinational corporations."

    "abstract": "There exists a shortage of studies that establish linkages between entrepreneurial orientation and debt financing in family businesses. In line with this research stream, the purpose of this chapter is to examine the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and debt financing of family businesses. Specifically, the study investigates how the five entrepreneurial orientation dimensions – risk-taking, innovativeness, proactiveness, competitive aggressiveness, and autonomy influence family business debt financing. By adopting a qualitative research methodology and based on empirical evidence gathered through a 10-case study design involving face-to-face interviews with owners of family businesses in Nigeria, the study examines the influence of entrepreneurial orientation on debt financing. The results suggest that the entrepreneurial orientation of family businesses seems to play a pivotal role in influencing debt financing. If a firm is entrepreneurial-oriented, it is reasonable to expect that it will focus attention on new and emerging opportunities for obtaining debt financing. The study advances research on entrepreneurial orientation and debt financing in family businesses. It develops an empirically theoretical framework at the intersection of the family business and entrepreneurial orientation research, filling a gap in the literature. Future research could substantiate the findings of this study on a broader empirical base, using quantitative methods. This study offers a new perspective to the study of entrepreneurial orientation and, at the same time, contributes with findings from research on entrepreneurial orientation to the study of debt financing in family businesses."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to emphasis the business and political linkages that are associated with performance. The inclusion of a politician or government official on the board is thought to vibrantly regard the firm as a resource value that leads to a competitive advantage. The engagement of these powerful figures verbally leads to the belief that a company with a resourceful person is very prominent in high-performing and high-risk industries that are economically advantageous to the country. The traditional perspective highlights that political involvement is particularly harmful for the firm due to control and ownership difficulties. The rhetorical engagement of these powerful people leads to the assumption that they are normally involved in high-performing and high-risk industries that are economically beneficial to the country. Contrary to the conventional view, some scholars suggest that political participation will continue to explore positive benefits for businesses such as profitability, subsidy, reputation, and investor trust for a long-term company strategy as proposed by the stakeholder theory and the helping hand theory. This paper examines the corporate performance in relation to political participation using 1218 datasets from Fortune Global 500 corporations, focusing mostly on oil and gas upstream activities from 2012 to 2017. All in all, our relationship hypothesis suggests that firms with strong political foundations are more likely to have an outsized impact on business performance and to be more market-sustained."

However, this Meta-Regression Analysis, by investigating these literatures jointly, is the first study that systematically measures and compares the effectiveness of these two policy instruments. After controlling for publication selection and sources of heterogeneity, we find that both tax credits and subsidies induce additional private R&D and that neither instrument systematically outperforms the other. However, whereas subsidy effects are increasing over time tax credit effects are not. Although their respective effects are “small”, they are not negligible: in round terms, an additional $1 of public R&D support of either type induces 7.5 cents of additional private R&D expenditure. Sources of heterogeneity in the reported effects include: tax credits are most effectively delivered as “incremental” schemes, are more effective in economies with a balanced “policy-mix” regime, and are generally less effective for micro firms and SMEs than for large firms; while subsidies are more effective for manufacturing firms, although not for high-tech firms, and are more effective than tax credits in economies predominantly using subsidies. Finally, we argue for the importance of statistical power in the design of evaluation studies."

We address whether there is a long-run relationship between exports and tourism and the direction of causality between these two variables. Our findings suggest a long-run relation between Singapore’s exports and inbound tourism and that the causation is bidirectional. This implies that inbound tourism in Singapore results in a higher demand for its domestic products. This increased demand for Singaporean products, in turn, acting as a positive advertising campaign in favor of Singapore, promotes inbound tourism to this country. The policy implication of these findings is twofold. First, inbound tourism in Singapore not only contributes directly to GDP, employment, and the current account via tourism revenues but also by stimulating exports it improves further the current account of Singapore. Secondly, the stimulation of exports induced by inbound tourism creates favorable sustainability conditions for the entire tourism sector. However, one should be cautious that this effect is taking more than 9 months to materialize and that inbound tourism may initially have a negative impact effect on Singapore’s exports as the overtime effect of tourism on exports exhibits a J-curve behavior."

These processes’ effectiveness depends on the data's quality and their structured or unstructured nature. We are witnessing a growing number of applications based on unstructured data mining in the accounting and management fields. This research aims to demonstrating that despite the traditional association between accounting and quantitative analyses (expected to be based mainly on structured financial data). The findings show that several useful applications now rely on unstructured data in this field. A basic analysis of the cybersecurity risks is also presented, along with mitigating strategies to allow companies to comply with current regulations such as the GDPR. The result might appear surprising from the business perspective, but it is not from a data science perspective. In conclusion the growing number of unsctructured data business applications should orientate a better understanding of their potential and target better training of finance specialist on data processing skills."

    "abstract": "The global interest in sukuk, an Islamic alternative to bond financing, has grown rapidly, particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, due to its distinctive features and investment quality. Sukuk were first launched in Malaysia and are presently available in 29 countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Despite the global market prevalence of sukuk, asset pricing literature has not yet addressed the pricing mechanism of sukuk, which is inherently different from bonds and equity due to the contractual differences. However, analysts use LIBOR, or the Islamic interbank benchmark rate, as the ad‐hoc benchmark to evaluate sukuk performance. In this study, we develop a basic pricing model that captures the common risks in sukuk returns. We identify two risk factors for sukuk that require risk premiums: (a) sukuk market risk and (b) information asymmetry risk. Using these two common sukuk risks factors, investment analysts can estimate the fair value of sukuk more precisely than other ad hoc measures available."

We use over 10,000 PIPEs in a global setting during 1995–2015 to assess how and through which channels institutional frameworks affect the issuers' performance. We document a significant decline in the market reaction, especially during 2004–2015 and find that firms issuing equity via PIPEs have significantly worse fundamentals. We also show that country governance matters as issuing firms operating in countries with better regulatory environments outperform others. Finally, we find that regulatory enforcement is a plausible underlying channel for the positive effect of the institutional frameworks on PIPEs performance."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Many transition economies are former socialist planned economies and have undergone market reforms of their financial sector to signal their transition towards democracy. However, governments in these countries have been reluctant to relinquish the pre-existing controls on economy and have adopted nuanced and sophisticated approaches to retain control. In such context, scholars may find it challenging to investigate the role played by the state in the success or failure of attempted market reforms. This work investigates the different forms of state-induced accounting controls that may preserve the status quo within the economy during transition, using Myanmar as an example. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a longitudinal qualitative research method aiming to reveal the very processes and mechanisms used by the banks and their evolution over time. This method is in accordance with the historical institutionalist perspective that they have applied within this research. Findings: The authors found that the Myanmar government embarked on the privatisation of their financial sector from 1990 to 2016 as a major public sector reform initiative. Under the guise of market reforms, it used both state-led and market-led controls to emulate and retain the socialist banking model where banks are used to fund the immediate government's budget deficits. This created a series of intended and unintended consequences, resulting in the ultimate failure of the government's market reforms. Research limitations/implications: Previously, research on public sector management accounting in emerging economies was not relying consistently on using theory. The relative limited theorisation led to gaps when attempting to understand and explain the opaque forms of state control mechanisms in transition economies. By applying historical institutionalist perspective, and a more theory-driven, reflective approach to the interpretation of the data collected, the authors have provided a deeper insight and understanding on how different forms of state controls can emerge, adapt and persist in transition economies such as Myanmar. Practical implications: The authors demonstrated that though the state may have implemented market reforms to signal regimes change, this does not necessarily mean that the government has relinquished their control on the economy. The state could take a more sophisticated, covert approach towards state controls leading to both intended and unintended consequences. Thus, even if the state's preferences change, the decisions cannot be easily reversed, as path-dependent state controls may have become pervasive affecting any further institutional and policy developments. Thus, the authors suggest that governments in both transition and developed economies should be cautious when enacting regulations on corporate control. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors have applied a historical institutional perspective in their analysis instead of the more widely used sociological, institutionalist approach. This allowed authors to harness rich longitudinal data indicating that market reforms and their success or failure should be examined as an ongoing process rather than a completed action. This is especially important in transition economies where the state may be unwilling to renounce the existing controls on the industry and may resort to more opaque forms of state control, eventually obstructing the intended reforms."

The introduction of private pensions is expected to reinforce inequalities as a result of socio-demographic features and pension system design. This article evaluates voluntary individual pension system with a perspective on pension equality. Monthly contributions to pension accounts are explored on the basis of socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the customers of a currently operating pension company. Findings reveal that differences in people’s saving capacities have become a source for pension inequality. Furthermore, state subsidies, which increase in proportion to individual contributions, strengthen unequal distributional dynamics. Pension privatization harms social solidarity as it intensifies existing social inequalities."

Using one of the largest bank-level datasets collected from 12 Middle East and North African (MENA) countries over the 2006-2013 period to-date, our findings are as follows. First, we find that risk disclosures have a predictive effect on BCRs. Second, we find that the relationship between risk disclosures and BCRs is contingent on the quality of governance structures. Specifically, we find that the informativeness of risk disclosures on BCRs is higher in banks with larger board size, greater independence, higher government ownership, and better Shariah supervisory board, but lower in banks with greater block ownership, higher foreign ownership and the presence of CEO duality. The central tenor of our findings remains unchanged after controlling for a number of firm- and country-level factors, alternative risk disclosure measures, firm- and national-level governance proxies, different types of banks, and potential endogeneities. The findings have important implications for investors, especially bondholders, standard-setters, regulators, and central governments."

However, there is a lack of evidence about other kinds of expertise that might be important for AC effectiveness which could contribute to the quality of financial statements. This study examines whether AC industry expertise and AC legal expertise have an impact on audit quality in a developing country (Jordan). Furthermore, mixed and inconsistent findings regarding the role played by female directors and the peculiarity of the Jordanian context creates a motive to examine the effect of AC gender diversity on audit quality. By utilizing 1,035 firm-year observations, using two proxies to capture audit quality, and employing different estimation methods, this study highlights the importance of AC industry expertise in ensuring high audit quality. AC legal expertise and AC gender diversity have no significant effect on audit quality. This study offers a valuable contribution to the literature, and also has implications for policy-makers in Jordan and other countries with similar institutional environments to consider for future regulatory reform."

    "abstract": "Banking stability is essential to any economy due to its many functions, including intermediation, payment facilitation, and credit creation. Thus, the stability of the banking industry is one of the critical ingredients in economic growth. This paper analyzes how bank capital, credit and liquidity requirements impact bank solvency, using ten major banks controlling 90% of the UK market share in 2009-2018. The GMM model indicates a strong association between credit and liquidity risks. That is, when banks finance a risky or distressed project, this will lead to an increase in nonperforming loans (NPL), which reduces bank liquidity. Poor liquidity profile of a bank may restrict its ability to act as a financial intermediary. In addition, the findings indicate that efficiency, asset quality, and economic growth have a significant positive effect on the solvency of banks. The results also show that the regulatory capital (Tier1) has a positive significant influence on bank solvency. Further, the results indicate that during the economic boom, banks tend to increase their regulatory capital. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that during the \"good time\", banks can accumulate enough capital that is genuinely capable of absorbing negative shock. Also, it is important for banks to ensure that they are efficient but also have a robust credit appraisal system to reduce NPL. This paper also demonstrates the implications of increased capital requirements. That is, increased capital requirements ensure not only banks are liquid but also solvent, which allows them to provide financial intermediation."

We conduct an online citizen science quasi- experiment concerning the delineation of metropolitan areas of Poland’s two major cities. It consists of two stages. In stage one, participants in one region are exposed to citizen science and directly involved in delineating the boundaries of their local metropolitan area. In stage two, we add another region in which participants are not involved in the research process. In both regions we ask the participants to evaluate the level of their trust in the presented maps of respective metropolitan areas: based on citizen science in one region and historical data regression analysis in the other region. Our contribution to the literature lies in two areas. First, we demonstrate how citizen science can be used in urban studies to delineate boundaries of urban and metropolitan areas exhibiting strong functional connections. Second, we show that the participation of local residents in the researchprocess increases public trust in the study results compared to non-participatory ‘traditional academic’ research. These results confirm that citizen science programs deserve to be strongly supported by European institutions as a possible means to resolving the credibility crisis of science, research and evidence-based policies."

We evaluate the quality of corporate and government mercury reporting via the Australian National Pollutant Inventory (NPI), which underpins Australia's reporting under the Minamata Convention, a global agreement to reduce mercury pollution. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative characteristics of accounting information are used as a theoretical frame to analyse ten interviews with thirteen interviewees as well as 54 submissions to the 2018 governmental enquiry into the NPI. Findings: While Australian mercury accounting using the NPI is likely sufficient to meet the expected Minamata reporting requirements (especially in comparison to developing countries), we find significant limitations in relation to comparability, accuracy, timeliness and completeness. These limitations primarily relate to government (as opposed to industry) deficiencies, caused by insufficient funding. The findings suggest that multiple factors are required to realise the potential of pollutant databases for corporate accountability, including appropriate rules, ideological commitment and resourcing Practical implications: The provision of additional funding would enable the NPI to be considerably improved (for mercury as well as other pollutants), particularly in relation to the measurement and reporting of emissions from diffuse sources. Originality/value: Whilst there have been prior reviews of the NPI, none have focused on mercury, whilst conversely prior studies which have discussed mercury information have not focused on the NPI. In addition, no prior NPI studies have utilised interviews nor have engaged directly with NPI regulators. There has been little prior engagement with pollutant databases in social and environmental accounting (SEA) research."

Specifically, we examine the impact of national-level SDG performance (NLSP) of 2015 to 2010, as a proxy for the non-enabling institutional environment, on SDGR observed in 2015/2016. This study also explores whether the NLSP-SDGR nexus is contingent on the environmental sensitivity of oil industries in Libya. We employ a quantitative content analysis based on word counts to determine the level of SDGR among a cross- sectional sample of 524 observations of the major Libyan oil companies in the 2015/2016 fiscal year. Using measures derived from the World Development Indicators (WDI), a cross-sectional regression analysis has been employed to investigate how NLSP explains variations in SDGR noted in 2015/2016. Descriptive evidence in- dicates that Libyan oil companies tend to report SDG information on their websites about Good Health and Well- being (SDG3), Quality Education (SDG4), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), and Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG12). Our regression results suggest that the NLSP positively and significantly influences corporate commitment to the SDGR agenda among a sample of the major oil com- panies in Libya. Additionally, the environmental sensitivity of oil industries appeared to be moderating the NLSP- SDGR nexus. As SDGR tends to be a self-regulation mechanism, our empirical evidence emphasises the impor- tance of establishing effective regulatory agencies to ensure companies’ achievements of their social, environ- mental, and economic responsibilities efficiently and effectively."

Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a panel of 2,538 public companies listed with the New York Stock Exchange to explain the impact of corporate governance deviance on firm’s performance. The authors relied on unique governance variables extracted from the Bloomberg database to develop the governance deviance index. Findings: Study unveils that deviance from governance practices influences firm’s performance. Consequently, it can be said that the firms which use innovative governance mechanisms, usually stay ahead of the market by leading the governance trends. The findings also generalise the firm’s entrepreneurial identity and organisational ecology perspectives. Research limitations/implications: Research implies that the firm’s entrepreneurial identity demands innovative managerial control. This study is focused on the US financial market, but in future, researchers could revalidate the deviance index. Scholars can also use mixed methods to test the need for innovative governance mechanisms in emerging markets. Practical implications: The firms should focus on innovative governance practices not only to safeguard the firm’s entrepreneurial identity but also to pursue the growth objectives. Such innovative mechanisms and managerial controls are helpful to deal with industrial transformations to satisfy key stakeholders. Originality/value: The study contributed to governance and management control research by sharing insights and catering the potential endogeneity problem faced to measure corporate governance measures. The study also proposes an alternative testing tool to measure governance deviance to add methodological uniqueness and reduce knowledge gap."

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate how state regulations become ineffective in holding corporations accountable for environmental degradation in an emerging economy context, with a specific focus on oil and gas and cement industry in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on capture theory to bring out the factors that have rendered redundant the state intervention to make corporations accountable for their environmental activities. The research setting is the oil and gas and cement industry in Nigeria. Data for the study are derived from both documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and analysed using a thematic technique. Findings: The findings of the paper demonstrate a regulatory failure to hold corporations to account for their environmental activities. A lack of political will, outdated regulations and the manipulation of the regulators, all have played a part in preventing corporations from being accountable for their activities. In addition, the widespread elite corruption in the country has provided corporations with leeway to manipulate their environmental accountability practices. The study emphasises the need for continuous review of the regulations and efforts to reduce corruption in order to promote corporations' environmental accountability in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to Nigeria, oil and gas and cement industries. The theoretical lens can be used to address problem of capture of the regulations and institution in the country. Practical implications: The practical implication is that it would enhance environmental regulations in Nigeria and emerging economies. It will also provide support from researchers emerging markets on the adoption of capture theory in future research. Social implications: It will promote corporate best environmental practices in the country. It will reduce the issues surrounding environmental accountability practices and create awareness on environmental issues among the populace. It will create the impression that corporations will be held accountable for their environmental activities in the country and the need to have improved environmental regulations in the country. Originality/value: The study adds to the debate on corporate environmental accountability practices engendering insights from the Nigerian oil and gas and cement industry. The paper demonstrates how companies in emerging economies can capture state regulations and how rendering environmental accountability becomes more of rhetoric than a reality with little impacts on the welfare of people and society."

    "abstract": "We investigate the nature of the relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) by examining how it changes across a third dimension that accounts for firm-specific factors. We propose a semi-latent specification of an endogenous control variable, which can, for the first time, explicitly identify, for each individual firm, the threshold level where the marginal impact of CSR on CFP turns positive. We provide empirical evidence that this threshold depends on the additional dimension and consequently, the previously reported U-shape seems to be an aggregation of relationships of differential magnitude and direction. This disaggregation fits the data better and therefore, we maintain that the addition of a higher dimension, along with the identification of the threshold level, can explain the conflicting results in the literature."

    "abstract": "Corruption has a complex relationship with economic growth. We have explored the impact of corruption on credit risk from a global perspective. The sample consists of 178 countries and covers 18 years that range from 2000 to 2017. Non-performing loan (NPL) is used as a proxy for credit risk and data regarding NPL is collected from the World Bank Database. Corruption scores are collected from the Transparency International reports. Panel regression results provide a positive association between corruption and credit risk for the global sample. Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) regression and robustness tests validate the findings. However, sub-sample analysis provides support for “grease the wheel” hypothesis for high corruption countries and indicate that corruption is beneficial in a weak form of governance and excessive regulatory pressure. This study advocate for the importance of strong governance mechanisms in high corruption countries that can minimize the impact of corruption on banking sector profitability and ensure economic development. Unlike past literature, we provide global evidence on the association between corruption and credit risk for the banking sector which allows generalizability."

Nine major databases were analyzed to review research articles from various business, management, higher education, and accounting journals for the period of 2004–2020. We follow the seven-step systematic review guidelines developed by Fink 2019 and we base our review analysis on fifty-eight journal articles. The systematic literature review results show a significant increase in the number of CSR article publications and the extent and trend of disclosure. The majority of prior research was based on questionnaires to evaluate the HEIs curriculum and focus on the CSR implication process. However, HEIs are still lagging behind in CSR implication and disclosure, and with a long way to go to obtain sustainability goals. From the study, several opportunities for future research emerged. This study can be useful for HEIs policymakers and practitioners to access the usefulness of CSR implications and disclosures in HEIs. In addition, this analysis assists scholars to explore in-depth the uncovered points related to CSR in HEIs context. This is the first systematic review of CSR implications and disclosures that comprehensively covers higher education institutions as a sector and presents a reference for academic literature from 2004 to 2020."

Bioplastics emerge as a promising solution, yet consumer understanding of this innovative material often lags, particularly in emerging markets. This study thus aims to explore effective marketing strategies for communicating bioplastic packaging to shape consumer adoption and disposal practices in such markets. Through a case study approach, we examine the role of ecolabels as a marketing tool across key sectors of the bioplastic packaging supply chain. Drawing upon the signalling theory, we identify key characteristics of effective signals, including costly signalling, visibility, clarity, fitness, consistency, and credibility, which should be integrated into a broader context of ecolabels design in order to encourage consumer adoption and responsible disposal. Our study also identifies instances where noises from the environment may have little impact and where communication gaps hinder feedback loops between consumers and producers."

We postulate that the effect of external arms embargoes on internal conflict is conditional, requiring empirical investigation. Our empirical analysis, based on the Panel Vector Autoregressive methods, reveals that the responses of political system and different indices of democracy to decreases in arms imports are positive, and the impact on military expenditures is negative, while the responses of education expenditures, health expenditures are positive. Despite this, our findings show that arms transfer restrictions can intensify ethnic tensions and internal conflicts."

Our results remain robust when addressing concerns of cross-sectional dependence, omitted variable bias, alternative definitions, and various alternative specifications. We explore three key economic mechanisms underlying our findings: firstly, FPE positively influences the prevalence of environmental regulations; secondly, it increases the stringency of environmental policies; and finally, it imposes a higher financial burden on businesses for environmental misconduct through tax collection. Our findings are significantly stronger in countries with higher levels of climate change exposure to the economy and human life, as well as in countries with higher levels of carbon emission and better-developed credit markets. However, the long-run impact is only significant in sample countries where females do not hold the top position in the government. Overall, our results provide important insights into how female political influence can yield positive outcomes in addressing financial challenges to environmental sustainability."

    "abstract": "Despite a longstanding debate around the economic effects of fiscal consolidation policies, relatively few studies have focused on developing countries, and even fewer have paid attention to the growth implications at firm level. Using a unique narrative dataset based on contemporaneous policy documents to identify changes in fiscal policy aimed at reducing the accumulation of public debt, we investigate the effects of fiscal consolidation on the growth of 118,279 firms in 98 developing countries from 2006 to 2018. The results indicate that a one percentage point increase in fiscal consolidation as a share of GDP leads, on average, to a decline in firm growth of 3.97 percentage points. This decline is reduced when consolidation is large. We also find that debt-driven consolidation based on tax hikes is more contractionary than that based on spending cuts, though this contractionary effect is mitigated when spending cuts exceed 1.5 percent of GDP. While the negative effect of fiscal consolidation on firm performance is more pronounced in large and non-exporting firms, the effect is not statistically important in low-debt-risk developing countries."

Using Crypto.com's sponsorship of the 2022 FIFA World Cup as the context, this mixed‐methods study utilises innovation resistance theory (IRT) and trust transfer theory (TTT) to investigate the extent to which such a sponsorship can increase trust and reduce barriers in innovative technologies such as cryptoassets, while also filling a research gap concerning consumer resistance to innovations in digital financial products and services. The findings of study 1, using a survey (n = 1081), and study 2 using interviews (n = 24) reveal that a positive image of sponsorship significantly influences favourability and interest, and trust of the product of the sponsor which subsequently reduces psychological barriers to adoption. Integrating the theoretical viewpoints of IRT and TTT, this study enhances our conceptual understanding regarding the psychological dimension of sponsorship and the extent to which a sponsorship generates interest, giving assurance and trust in the sponsor's product, and removing uncertainty; thus, reducing barriers to adoption."

With the sole exception of one de jure index, all other financial liberalization measures consistently indicate an improvement in cost efficiency. We also compare the effects before and after the 2007 global financial crisis, which instigated a policy shift from deregulation to prudential re–regulation. We find that prudential re–regulation did not detrimentally affect bank cost efficiency. Our results for the main financial liberalization measures hold irrespective of countries’ stage of economic development and prove robust to re–estimations based on a single-country efficiency frontier for the US, alternative model specifications and methodologies that account for endogeneity and cross section dependence. The key policy implication from our findings is that prudential policies aimed at fostering stability and less bank risk–taking, can be pursued without any risks of hindering financial intermediation and lowering bank cost efficiency."

These events trigger psychological reactions in the market and susceptible to irrational decisions that challenge logical assumptions. The rapidity of the crisis has led to highly volatile market conditions, fostering instances of asymmetric information. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of attention on market dynamics by examining diverse possibilities over time. The article focused on all publicly listed industries on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX/BEI). Using time series regression data from 1997 to 2020, the article comprised 5,615 observations across nine sectors. The primary model was based on three factors originating from the Fama-French and prospect theory, with attention serving as the main risk element to assess the impact of attention on abnormal returns (AR) during RE. The results disclosed that various events showed diverse effects on attention behavior, varying across all sectors. Additionally, moderation analysis showed a correlation between attention and AR. The results signified that RE mitigates the negative relationship between attention and AR. The adverse impact of attention on AR diminishes during RE. These results contributed to the literature by providing insights into the excessive attention to specific information disrupts market mechanisms, triggers disproportionate emotional responses, and alters investor preferences. Furthermore, this study established that events prompting excessive attention have varying effects on attention behavior across all sectors."

We conduct a series of regressions addressing the managerial attributes determinants of future stock price crashes including gender diversity, CEO age, and CEO power (measured by CEO pay disparity, CEO tenure and CEO duality). Our empirical results reveal a positive association between insider purchases and price crash risk. This implies that other than compensation and career concerns, insiders hoard bad news to fulfil their trading incentives. Our positive coefficients of insider sales also suggest that insider sellers can assess inside information promptly and anticipate shortly before the crashes. We further document that the presence of female directors on boards can mitigate stock price crash risk. However, firms with powerful or younger Chief Executive Officers are more likely to experience crashes. Overall, we highlight the importance of corporate managerial attributes in dealing with information asymmetry problems."

First, an increase in abnormal returns from insider purchases lowers the probability of a CEO’s turnover, while an increase in abnormal returns from insider sales increases the likelihood of a CEO’s dismissal. Second, the CEO pay gap negatively affects the probability of CEO turnover for insider purchases, but it does not have a similar effect on insider sales. Third, the interaction between insider abnormal returns and any CEO pay disparity influences the impact of these returns on CEO turnover. Specifically, this interaction diminishes the positive effect of insider selling on the probability of a CEO’s dismissal, offsets the negative effect of insider purchasing on CEO dismissal, and, finally, amplifies the negative impact of CEO pay disparity on the probability of a CEO’s dismissal during periods witnessing insider purchases."

This study aims to examine how national culture-religiosity affects that decision. The authors further examine how foreign-owned MNCs might behave differently from local MNCs, although the host country’s cultural-religiosity value might influence that decision. Design/methodology/approach: This study obtains the data from three sources: Hofstede Framework, Pew Research Center and World Bank Enterprise Survey in cross-sectional mode. The final sample consists of 8,590 SMNCs from 45 countries as the observations. This study uses robust regression analysis to test the effects of culture, religiosity and controlling shareholders on the audited financial statements decision. Findings: The regression results support the hypothesis, whereas cultural-religiosity values are associated with the audited financial report. The findings confirm stakeholder theory and institutional theory. Originality/value: This study fills a gap in the literature by providing empirical evidence on the cultural and religiosity effects on the accounting decision of SMNCs. The results can be used as the foundation for future research related to MNCs’ managerial behavior toward accounting policies, especially with the psychosocial factors."

    "abstract": "Purpose\n\nThis study aims to explore the potential dynamics between performance measurement at the organisational level and emerging urban development projects at the macro-institutional field level of sustainability governance and accountability.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nUsing a theoretical triangulation between three theories, namely contingency theory, institutional theory and social cognitive theory, this study investigates not only the macro-micro dynamics, but also the (recursive) micro-macro dynamics between performance measurement and urban development. Using an Egyptian public sector urban development organisation and its sustainable energy project as an empirical example, interviews, documents and observations were collected.\n\nFindings\n\nThe dynamics emerged between field urban development projects and the (unintended) organisational implementation of the performance measurement system, the sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs) reporting system. Contributing to previous literature, these dynamics have been institutionalised through (three) interrelated levels: the (macro-field) urban development contingencies and pressures for sustainability KPIs reporting, the (organisational) institutionalisation of the urban development performance measurement system and then the (micro-organisational) cognitive role of sustainability KPIs reports in (re)making political urban development decisions.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\n\nThis study faced some limitations that paved the way for future research axes. For political and security reasons, difficulties were encountered in conducting interviews with government actors in the sustainable energy project under study. Also, due to the practical separation of the environmental sustainability system from the sustainability KPIs reporting system in this case study, environmental sustainability is outside the scope.\n\nPractical implications\n\nSustainability reports may influence public sector decision-making processes in a specific urban development context. These KPIs reports may also increase public sector management opportunities for urban auditing, transparency, accountability and sustainability governance. These KPIs may also guide public sector management to lower prices in poor villages to increase smart energy consumption and improve community health.\n\nSocial implications\n\nSustainability reports may increase decision-makers' understanding of consumer behaviours and societal changes. This may help in making appropriate political decisions to improve their welfare and regular smart energy consumption. Not only urban citizens, but this social advantage may also extend to urban development employees through employees' promotion, training and access to government-funded academic and professional scholarships.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nThis study is an attempt to develop current public sector performance measurement analyses in the emerging urban development field using a triadic analytical approach. This study also fed the literature with an extended case study that clarified the (multi-level) and (two-way) dynamics between performance measurement and urban development."

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the performance discrepancies between shariah-compliant and non-shariah-compliant exchange-traded funds (ETFs), aiming to enrich the academic and practical understanding of Islamic finance‘s nuances in the ETF sector. Design/methodology/approach: Initiating with a broad literature review to cement a theoretical backdrop on Islamic investment principles and the mechanics of shariah-compliant ETFs, the research progresses to devise a comparative analytical framework. This framework focuses on assessing ETF performance through metrics like net asset value returns and volatility, specifically analyzing Blackrock ETFs to draw distinctions in portfolio outcomes and asset compositions. Findings: The examination highlights discernible variances in portfolio performance between shariah-compliant and their conventional counterparts, presenting instances where shariah-compliant ETFs, such as ISUS from Blackrock, deliver competitive returns despite their generally lower net assets compared to conventional ETFs like VUSA from Vanguard. Moreover, the ISUS ETF‘s holdings investigation revealed discrepancies with AAOIFI standards, questioning its strict Shariah compliance and adding depth to the analysis of Islamic financial instruments‘ integrity. Originality/value: This paper significantly advances the scholarly dialogue on Islamic financial practices within the ETF landscape, providing empirical evidence of performance differentials and compliance intricacies. While prior research has touched upon Islamic investing, this study pioneers a detailed comparative scrutiny, equipped with a novel methodological approach, to dissect the shariah-compliant ETFs‘ operational and ethical frameworks, offering invaluable insights for investors, financial analysts and Islamic finance scholars."

    "abstract": "The public sector literature on sustainability management accounting (SMA) has grown significantly in recent years, with numerous theoretical and empirical studies examining the purported link between management accounting and corporate sustainability within organisations. However, despite this surge, prior studies have largely confined their analytical scope to traditional SMA issues, such as corporate social, environmental, and governance responsibilities. Their analyses have predominantly concentrated on largely investigated elements such as situational linkages, transformational dynamics, agency issues, resistance, and conflicts. This study aims to address these limitations by examining corporate SMA systems within the burgeoning field of urban development. It utilises institutional theory and a case study from Egypt, a developing country, to explore how urban development could impact adopting a corporate SMA system in politically sensitive state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Contrary to existing literature, the findings indicate that urban development has created financial pressures for national governments, which have used these as a political instrument to implement a corporate SMA system within related SOEs. Additionally, the findings highlight the significant role of management accountants as central figures in integrating and standardising a corporate SMA system into the daily practices of current executives through advanced enterprise resource planning (ERP) technology. Moreover, as a development of institutional theory, the findings demonstrate the influence of corporate SMA reports on the decision-making processes of national governments in the context of urban development."

We decompose the finance premium into a cost effect and a leverage effect. We show that in both the cost channel model and the credit channel model (Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist 1999), the cyclicality of the finance premium is determined mainly by the size and sign of the leverage effect. Some key factors that determine the leverage effect are, the nature of shocks, the degree of loan persistence in relation to output or net worth, and the stance of monetary policy."

    "abstract": "The biggest single expansion of the European Union (EU), in terms of population and territory, occurred in 2004 when ten new members, often called the A10, joined the fifteen existing members. The first decade of the 21st century also saw unprecedented levels of growth in these countries, a ‘Golden Age’ of economic growth – which many have partly attributed to the accession process and concomitant institutional change, and partly due to the free trade strategies\npursued within the largest single market in the world. This paper looks at the financial aspect of this burgeoning real economic expansion and investigates the role of financial development in economic growth. Using a panel model with\ndata covering periods from 1997–2020, and allowing for spatial correlation, we distinguish between indicators of financial institutions and financial markets. Within each subcategory, we check for the impact effect of financial depth, access, and efficiency – the three major criteria for economic growth. We find that financial development pertaining to financial institutions is of significant importance, while financial markets have relatively lower effects. This implies\nthat the institutional and regulatory structure, as provided by the accession to the EU, may have played the most crucial role in stimulating economic growth. The ‘Golden Age’, we contend, was catalyzed by financial development broadly, and financial deepening, in particular. However, it was predominantly spurred by the growth of financial institutions arguably facilitated by the accession to the EU."

Considering the smooth structural breaks, we employed the Fourier-based unit root tests to assess the weak-form efficient market hypothesis. We used multiple frequency datasets of global financial stock market indexes that span over 20 years to have comprehensive analysis and robustness in the results. The study is performed from distinct sub-sample periods of the global financial crisis, including the pre-crisis period (2000–2007), the crisis and post-crisis period (2008–2020), and the overall sample period (2000–2020). We observed seven stock markets in the total sample period and twelve in the pre-crisis period, which were weak-form efficient across different frequency data sets. During the crisis and post-crisis period, just four out of sixteen stock market indexes were found to be weak in efficiency based on Fourier unit root tests. Given the superior properties of the Fourier unit root tests, this study reiterates that investors may receive a stream of arbitrage benefits in all markets due to the inefficiency of these countries. We offer investment implications that enable forecasting future stock price changes based on past performance and creating trading methods that produce anomalous profits."

    "abstract": "Chinese civilization is one of the few ancient civilisations that has endured. For\nmillennia and centuries, Chinese architecture and urbanism were very much influenced by the teachings of Confucius and the principles of Taoism. However, this long-term trend drastically changed after World War Two. There has always been an underlying theoretical nexus between the spheres of politics, urbanism and architecture. In 1949, when the Communists seized power in China, one of their prime objectives was to radically transform the physical, social and economic environments of the cities. They shelved Confucianism and Taoism and forged new principles and directives for urban development. The main aim of this study is to trace the determinants behind urban development in China, during the Cold War between 1949 and 1991. Additionally, it identifies the ramifications for contemporary Chinese cities and other Communist countries. The study adopts a qualitative research approach, involving document analysis, field surveys and observations. The research confirms that until 1979, the Chinese Maoist city elements inspired urban transformation. More broadly, it identifies the extent to which traditions, trends and political ideologies influenced the transformation of urban environments and landscapes in the People’s Republic of China. However, from 1979 capitalist influences, accentuated by unprecedented rural-urban migration, altered the mode of urbanisation towards commercial property-led development. An unfortunate side effect of this recent phase of Chinese urbanisation was the destruction of traditional hutongs. Exposure to\nclimate change impacts, including drought and heatwaves, may yet reign in the worst proclivities of ill-considered current commercial development practices, and resuscitate fruitful aspects of ancient Confucian, Taoist or Feng Shui wisdom"

    "abstract": "This study examines the evolution of the capital structure of European firms during the global financial crisis and European debt crisis. We compare the experiences of SMEs, listed firms and private firms in different industries and investigate the role of country and institutional factors in affecting capital structure. We find that SMEs, private firms, and non-listed firms experience lower declines in leverage relative to large firms during the global financial crisis and the European debt crisis. During these crises’ periods, SMEs experience steeper declines in debt maturity, which suggests reliance on short term debt that carries high roll over risks. This behaviour is protracted for firms in the agriculture industry. Both the global financial crisis and EU debt crisis have asymmetric effects on leverage, long term debt issuance and debt maturity across different industries, and across firms of different sizes. Moreover, in countries with more developed financial systems, stronger frameworks for insolvency, resolving firm insolvency, and strong systems for shareholder suits, and director liability, SMEs experience much lower reduction in leverage and debt maturity. This finding suggests that institutional factors help attenuate adverse capital supply shocks."

The objectives of the present study are to examine the relationship between job stress and the organizational commitment of employees and to determine the moderating influence of job satisfaction on the relationship between job stress and organizational commitment. An empirical quantitative approach using a survey method was utilized, involving 112 employees who work at various palm oil plantations in Malaysia. The sampling method used is convenience sampling, which is based on respondents’ ease of access, geographical proximity, availability and willingness to participate. The data were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling approach. The result showed that job stress is negatively related to organizational commitment, while job satisfaction does not moderate the relationship between job stress and organizational commitment. These research results provide practical guidelines for management practices in the palm oil industry. The current study promotes the management of palm estate states or smallholder plantations to employ strategies that reduce job stress among the employees, which, in turn, will boost the organizational commitment of the employees to the organization. Suggestions for future research are also elaborated on."

The study utilizes panel data from the largest listed MNEs between 2009 and 2019. The findings suggest that the impact of ESG reporting on financial performance varies significantly across different quantile levels of firm performance. Specifically, the positive effect of board characteristics, as measured by the Board Organization and Characteristics Index (BOCI), on the relationship between ESG reporting and financial performance is observed at the median and higher quantiles. However, the study also reveals a negative moderating effect of BOCI on the relationship between ESG disclosure and market-based measures at the lower and median quantiles, but not at the upper quantile level. The study highlights the importance of board characteristics in the complex interplay between ESG reporting and financial performance for MNEs."

This study reviews the SI literature in the context of accounting, examines how the literature on TEA has evolved over the years, and finally contributes to the analysis of how TEA is related to integration. A key theme is the connection of accounting controls and system integration. The methodology of the four design principles of control in system integration is adopted. Transparency is the main perspective of these principles. It was found that TEA promotes transparency, reduces the risk of fraud, and facilitates system integration."

Using a uniquely modified set of bivariate asymmetric GARCH models, we investigate one-way return and volatility transmissions from the international Brent oil market, natural gas markets, carbon markets, and naira-dollar exchange market to the NGX. Firstly, we document direct and asymmetric return and volatility transmissions from the Brent oil market to the NGX, denoting the fragile sensitivity of the NGX to international oil price turbulence. Secondly, we find a direct volatility transmission from natural gas markets to the NGX, implying an increasing reliance on natural gas exports by the Nigerian government. Thirdly, we document an inverse volatility transmission from carbon markets to the NGX, indicating Nigeria's negative reaction, as a major oil and gas producer, to increasing global sustainable production activities. Fourthly, the insignificant effect of the naira-dollar official exchange rate on volatility in the NGX demonstrates the spurious impression that Nigeria's exertion of control over the exchange rate is shielding the economy. In sum, our results confirm that the openness of the NGX makes it vulnerable to external shock transmissions from related external markets subsisting outside Nigeria. Our results are robust to an alternative estimation procedure that employs a different measure of price volatility from the three external markets."

While the majority of these studies have addressed this role from the perspective of openness, participation, and hybridisation, others have addressed it in terms of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Despite their early efforts often focusing on institutionalisation and governmentality processes, their analyses did not address how management accounting tools can be used to achieve sustainable goals, particularly in developing countries with a political and cultural character. This study aims to explore how an activity-based costing/ABC system is configured within urban development organisations to internalise cultural and political sustainability values at the smart city level. It applies a politico-cultural model and uses a case study approach from an Egyptian state-owned smart city enterprise. The findings reveal smart city culture and political/government compliance in the implementation of the ABC system, enabled by enterprise resource planning/ERP technology, within state-owned enterprises/SOEs. This system, seen as an emerging field, was created as a multi-lens reporting system on their political and cultural sustainability in smart cities. While political sustainability refers to SOEs’ compliance with the ABC system, cultural sustainability refers to the embodiment of national smart city values in their system implementation. This sustainability costing system of a political and cultural nature has also created recursive dynamics, exemplified by the powerful role of ERP-ABC reports in making participatory sustainability decisions at various organisational and governmental levels for smart cities."

However, evidence of their effectiveness in curbing plastic waste pollution or in redirecting the continent towards a circular plastic economy remains under-researched. We assess plastic waste policies in Africa using Chatham Database and the DITCh Plastic Survey data, combined with one national case study (Nigeria). We utilise machine learning for text analysis of policy description. We find the continent’s efforts ineffective at directing the continent towards a circular economy due to shallow regulations, exclusion of the informal recycling sector, enforcement problems and lack of awareness of policies, amongst others. We present some broad propositions on how digital and technological tools can be used to redirect the continent from linear to circular economy and how they can also aid in plastic waste policy effectiveness. This chapter is relevant to policy making in three ways. Firstly, it shows how plastic-oriented policies are not circular in nature in Africa. Secondly, it posits that under current ineffective plastic waste policies in Africa, digital technology is an instrument that can be used to achieve a plastic circular economy. Thirdly, the realisation of the first makes a call for an innovation policy agenda (strategic direction such as digital interoperability) if Africa is to scale plastic circular economy."

While the literature is replete with lots of studies in this area, the majority of the extant research is focused on the actual interventions in a wide range of national contexts that are often difficult to compare. Very few studies have addressed the critical subject of building capacity for the circular economy in the global south. The present study addresses this important gap, drawing on qualitative data from five (5) focus groups and twelve (12) semi-structured interviews, triangulated with quantitative data from 151 students across four (4) Nigerian Universities, this study addresses the gap by examining the predictors of students&#8217; participation in the circular plastic economy. The findings, from structural equation modeling of survey data and reflective analysis of interviews, indicate that Nigerian university students are more likely to participate in the circular plastic economy through a high prominence of soft power features such as increased awareness, inspiration, idea generation, encouragement, and capacity building. This underlines the importance of targeted policy interventions and pedagogic innovations to drive awareness and knowledge-building among Nigeria&#8217;s youth population."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the use of the return on gold instead of treasury bills in empirical asset pricing models for the US equity market. It builds upon previous research on the safe-haven, hedging, and zero-beta characteristics of gold in developed markets and the close relationship between interest rates, stock, and gold returns. In particular, we extend this research by showing that using gold as a zero-beta asset helps to improve the time-series performance of asset pricing models when pricing US equities and industries between 1981 and 2015. The performance of gold zero-beta models is also compared with traditional empirical factor models using the 1-month Treasury bill rate as the risk-free rate. Our results indicate that using gold as a zero-beta asset leads to higher R-squared values, lower Sharpe ratios of alphas, and fewer significant pricing errors in the time-series analysis. Similarly, the pricing of small stock and industry portfolios is improved. In cross-section, we also find improved results, with fewer cross-sectional pricing errors and more economically meaningful pricing of risk factors. We also find that a zero-beta gold factor constructed to be orthogonal to the Carhart four factors is significant in cross-section and helps to improve factor model performance on momentum portfolios. Furthermore, the Fama–French three- and five-factor asset pricing models and the Carhart model are all improved by these means, particularly on test assets which have been poorly priced by the traditional versions. Our results have salient implications for policymakers, governments, central bank rate-setting decisions, and investors."

In this study, the authors examine the role of audit committee in the dividend policy of Malaysian financial firms. They collect data from a sample comprising 40 financial institutions, spanning a 13-year period from 2010 to 2022. The empirical findings gleaned from this study unequivocally affirm a statistically significant relationship between the existence of audit committee and the formulation of dividend policies within these financial institutions. Notably, audit committees have been revealed to exert a robust and statistically significant influence on dividend policy within these financial institutions. The implications of these findings extend beyond the confines of academia; they hold substantial relevance for regulatory bodies, financial institutions themselves, and their shareholders in the Malaysian context."

It employs four most commonly used theories which are then tested using 19-year banking-firm market data. The usefulness of these models demonstrates with promising results.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper conducts a multi-country study using the multi-model testing approach to evaluate validity of theories and forecast accuracy of banking firms. It employs four methodology models used in finance literature; (1) P/E multiples model, (2) accounting-information-based clean surplus model, (3) theoretical model based on Gordon and Shapiro (1956) method and (4) the Damodaran-Kottler Free Cash Flow or FCF theory based on discounting model.\n\nFindings\nThe tests show that the four theories under tests have a significant fit with actual price formation. The explained variation ranges from 72 to 92%, so the explanatory power of the theories accounting for variations in bank prices over 19-year period is substantial. The models fit suggest that the P/E model has superior predictive power followed by the RIM, DDM and FCFE. These findings shed new lights on the relative performance of valuation models.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe study is limited in terms of the sample period size for 1999–2019. The availability of essential financial data prior to 2000 is very limited, so one can understand interpretation of statistical results under certain assumptions.\n\nPractical implications\nThe paper suggests that one-factor model is better than the two-factor model.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe work done in this paper is unpublished and original contribution to banking and finance literature and also not under consideration for publication in any other journal."

Though series of policies, laws and spending have been put in place, indicators of healthcare in Nigeria have been poor and burdened by regional and location disparities. This study sets out to find which segment of the society that might likely benefit from extra investment in the sector. Utilizing the harmonised living standard dataset and employing a marginal benefit incidence analysis, the study found that marginal odds estimates were pro-poor for most southern regions with little urban bias for primary and secondary healthcare different from results from northern regions. On the reflex, the tertiary level estimates were decidedly pro-rich at the margin across regions and locations. The study recommended reforms in the sectors that will be reflected in budgeting and legal frameworks to achieve targets by impact and by need. Reforms that will consider regional specific issues will improve cost efficiency of additional spending. This must be done before additional funding to different levels for sustainable efficiency and effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Introduction/Main Objectives: This research aims to examine the effects of cash holdings on a firm's R&D intensity. We further examine how that relationship may be varied across different controlling share-holders. For robustness reasons, we test it in a developing market and a developed market. Background Problems: Economics and business theories state that research and development (R&D) is susceptible to financing constraints due to the lack of collateral value and asymmetric information issues. This argument has been extensively debated with no consensus being reached. Therefore current study focuses on the examination of R&D and cash holding and the role of controlling shareholders. Novelty: The current study considers the importance of controlling shareholders on the relationship between cash holding and R&D intensity. We expect that different controlling shareholders will have different constraints on R&D financing. Research Methods: This study focuses on a sample of public listed companies in Malaysia and Singapore from the year 2012 to 2018, and estimates the model under a two-step GMM panel regression to eliminate the endogeneity issue. Finding/Results: The results show that cash holdings have significant effects on the intensity of R&D. However, that relationship is different across countries and across controlling shareholders. Malaysia's foreign firms will increase their R&D's intensity when their cash holdings are high. Meanwhile, Singaporean family firms will reduce the intensity of their R&D when their cash holdings are high. Overall the findings confirm the hypothetical alignment of the agency theory and also the resource-based view theory. Conclusion: Our findings surmise that higher cash holdings cause a lower R&D intensity due to the cash management decisions by managers. A firm with high leverage tends to reduce its R&D intensity when cash holdings are high, and vice versa. This behavior can be found in all the controlling shareholders."

Studies utilizing multiple-country data, multinational companies, small firms or regions covering Africa, the Middle East, Eastern-Europe and South America are under-represented. It critiques the methodological weaknesses of some empirical studies and proposes that future researchers should use multiple firm performance measurements, a longitudinal research design, and an integrative framework to better control the direct and moderating factors. Future researchers may advance the robustness of research by using multiple theoretical lenses to consider how various governance factors moderate the relationship between board leadership structure and firm performance, particularly the different ownership structures, managerial discretion contexts and national institutional factors."

Documentary review and semi-structured interviews are used for data collection. Analysis is informed by the ‘Institutional Logics Perspective’ and Bourdieu’s notion of ‘power as capital in a field’.\nFindings: Research findings illustrate how some local actors pre-dispose themselves in promoting strict compliance to IFRS, while others endeavour to ensure compliance to ‘Islamic Sharia requirements’ in financial reporting. In this power dynamic, there is an ongoing ‘constructive resistance’ actively exerted by the latter group against the former, preserving the existence of religion-based reporting demands in Islamic accounting standardisation approaches. The paper also highlights chronological ‘dynamic’ accounts that explain the evolvement of institutional logics prevailing in these projects over different historical stages at both national and international levels.\nOriginality/value: This paper’s findings contrast and challenge the existing assumption that the ‘epistemic community’ promoting IFRS agenda always faces ‘passive responses’ from local actors. Moreover, the paper’s offering of a dynamic view to institutional logic mapping extends the previously used ‘static analyses’ of logics prevailing in Islamic accounting standardisation projects."

By including a sample of 159 firms listed on three Asian stock markets from 2013 to 2017, this study found that the effects of corporate governance mechanisms vary significantly among the three Asian markets. Specifically, this study shows that board size has positively influenced listed firms' financial performance in the Singapore Exchange. However, our findings show that board size has negatively affected listed firms' financial performance in Thailand's Stock Exchange. In addition, our results reveal that board independence has negatively influenced listed firms' financial performance in Bursa Malaysia. Finally, this study provides implications for regulatory authorities in the Asian stock markets to separate between chairman and CEO roles since most Asian firms are owned and directed by business families."

However, despite a few prior studies acknowledging the negative externalities of political activity, little attention has been paid to CPA’s dark side. In this paper, we draw on institutional and corporate governance insights to examine the relationship between CPA and bribery, which is arguably the greatest institutional failure in developing countries. Using pooled data from over 25,000 firms in 41 African countries, we find that lobbying and firm-level bribery are positively related. This relationship is weakened by in-country internet penetration and foreign ownership of firms. Taken together, the results suggest that business-government relations in weak institutional environments help to perpetuate corruption. They also suggest that internet penetration and foreign ownership help to illuminate the dark side of CPA. Leveraging this understanding, we make important contributions to the literature and highlight pertinent practical implications."

Despite this, the progress in realizing sustainable development remains as a challenge in the global perspective and yet it should be eliminated. The world is facing a pragmatic threat of climate change which potentially damage the Earth’s ecosystems. There is a need for all relevant parties to cooperatively care for the environment in decreasing the environmental degradation and climate change in achieving sustainability to leave no one left behind. Our study highlights the perception of the firm at firm-level that can link environmental sustainability practices and firm performance, especifically in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Hence, in this study, we will examine how corporate sustainability orientation influences firm performance, and how corporate sustainability orientation influences firm performance through environmental practices with the use of the Natural Resource-based View (NRBV) theory and Stakeholder theory. This study uses a judgmental sampling method with a set of criteria to have an accurate result for the study. A total of 219 responses were collected and this study uses a Partial Least Squares – Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach in data analysis. From the analysis, both corporate sustainability orientation and environmental practices were found significant, while the relationship between corporate sustainability orientation and firm performance was found significant through the indirect effect. For future studies, this study suggests researcher to explore corporate sustainability orientation in the perspective of firm-level and individual-level to have a comparison in terms of perception towards sustainability practices and how it impacts the firm performance."

Further, the study provides unique evidence that Asian firms with large boards and gender diversity have a moderating effect and strengthen the negative influence of political connections on cash holdings. We also find that CEO duality moderates the influence of political connections on cash holdings in Asian countries. The authors conclude that strong board monitoring and governance mechanisms are crucial for the effective use of cash, particularly in firms with political connections. This research contributes to the literature by presenting novel evidence that board characteristics critically influence the relationship between political connections and cash holdings in the Asian context."

By using panel data of 20 selected African countries from 1995 to 2020, we investigate whether all types of financial development have the same relationship with natural resources. In doing so, a recently developed novel estimation technique, spatial econometric, is employed for the first time to estimate the FD-NR relationship and account for the possible spillover effect of financial development in one country on the neighbouring countries. The novelty of this methodology is to consider structural breaks and the heterogeneity issues that are common in panel data. The main findings of this paper are that there is a robust negative effect of natural resource rents on both stock market capitalization ratio and available private credit. Furthermore, the empirical evidence suggests new insights for policymakers to use appropriate and sophisticated policies to boost the development of the financial sector in African countries over the long term. More policy implications are further discussed in this study."

Using 234 UK non-financial companies, we find that longer co-tenure between ACC and EP improves accruals quality and reduces the propensity to meet or beat the earnings benchmark. Moreover, we do not find a significant relationship between ACC–EP shared tenure and audit fees, alleviating the concern that ACC–EP shared tenure could lead to collusion or inappropriate favoritism towards the EP regarding audit fees.

    "abstract": "We examine the information content of insiders' investment horizon using a large sample of Australian insider trades from 2002 to 2021. In contrast to the finding of Akbas et al. (2020) in the U.S. context, we find that, while Australian insiders are predictive of future abnormal returns, their trading horizon contains little relevant information. We further find that Australian insider trades are dominated by purchasing transactions, which is contrary to the U.S. insider transactions that are predominately selling transactions. Our study provides useful insights for investors who are interested in detecting insiders' information, and for policy makers who strive for setting more effective insider trading laws."

    "abstract": "This case study explores the significant reasons for the failure of British Home Stores (BHS). We employed a case study analysis based on Tafflers bankruptcy model and SWOT analysis to predict the failure of BHS Group. Our results reveal that the management and leadership of the BHS group are accountable for the eventual failure of the BHS company. The crucial insight for this case study was to discuss 'what incorrect business decisions were taken and led to drop precipitously in 3 to 4 years'. We argue that retail companies must seek proactive financial services if they face financial distress. In addition, this study recommends reducing borrowings and adjusting staff levels by adopting click and collect services or expanding online shopping spaces. More importantly, irresponsible management, weak governance practices, less up-to-date technological enhancement, and failure to predict companies' financial health are all crucial elements of the retail companies failure."

    "abstract": "Fake news, misinformation and disinformation have significantly increased over the past years, and they have a profound effect on societies and supply chains. This paper examines the relationship of information risks with supply chain disruptions and proposes blockchain applications and strategies to mitigate and manage them. We critically review the literature of SCRM and SCRES and find that information flows and risks are relatively attracting less attention. We contribute by suggesting that information integrates other flows, processes and operations, and it is an overarching theme that is essential in every part of the supply chain. Based on related studies we create a theoretical framework that incorporates fake news, misinformation and disinformation. To our knowledge, this is a first attempt to combine types of misleading information and SCRM/SCRES. We find that fake news, misinformation and disinformation can be amplified and cause larger supply chain disruptions, especially when they are exogenous and intentional. Finally, we present both theoretical and practical applications of blockchain technology to supply chain and find support that blockchain can actually advance risk management and resilience of supply chains. Cooperation and information sharing are effective strategies."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Prior studies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and performance have frequently used unidirectional, single-equation regression although the literature recommends the reciprocal association of CSR with firm performance. This paper aims to elucidate the interactive relationship of CSR spending with financial inclusion (FI) and firm performance. The study also explores the moderating impact of the level of FI on the CSR-firm performance relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a simultaneous equations model to capture the FI, CSR and firm performance relationships and apply a three-stage regression approach and generalised method of moments approach to address possible endogeneity. Findings: The results confirm a positive association of CSR spending with performance but a negative relationship of FI with performance. This paper also finds that FI negatively moderates the CSR spending-performance relationship. Practical implications: The positive impact of CSR spending and the negative impact of FI on performance in mandatory CSR regimes provides valuable input in policy formulation. The results of the study will also be useful to national and international organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Originality/value: This study uses a simultaneous equations model to capture the reciprocal association of CSR spending with firm performance, whereas prior studies on CSR and performance have frequently used unidirectional, single-equation regression. This paper also finds that FI negatively moderates the CSR spending- performance relationship. Including FI and exploring the moderating impact of the level of FI on the CSR-firm performance relationship is novel."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Women's financial inclusion has become a global research agenda, and past studies provide mixed evidence on the determinants of financial inclusion among women entrepreneurs across the globe. However, the impact of digital financial literacy on women's financial inclusion has seldom been addressed in the past literature. Design/methodology/approach: The authors perform a cross-sectional analysis of 144 countries using the World Bank Global Findex Database. Findings: This study’s probabilistic regression results indicate that women entrepreneurs with a higher degree of digital financial literacy are more likely to engage in formal banking channels. Practical implications: The study findings have practical implications in terms of allowing regulators and banks to draw effective policies to attract women customers. Lack of effective regulatory intervention could lead to women exploring financial crimes, such as money laundering, due to their lack of involvement with the formal banking channel. Originality/value: The authors explore the impact of digital financial literacy on women's financial inclusion. Such evidence is rare in the existing literature.

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to identify the main research development on board diversity and offers a quantitative synopsis of key themes and contributors, knowledge gaps and provides directions for further work. Design/methodology/approach: Using a bibliometric analysis, the authors assess the patterns in global board diversity research based on co-occurrences of researchers’ keywords and publication outputs of 991 articles from the Scopus database. Also, the co-citation network analysis was performed to assess the intellectual structure of board diversity research. Findings: According to the keyword analysis, the authors found that researchers focus on the gender diversity of the boardroom while ignoring the cognitive diversity and other aspects of demographic diversity such as educational, ethnic, age, nationality, experience, background and tenure, pointing to the need for further work to consider other diversity attributes and the interaction between them. Additionally, board diversity research related to (but not limited to) payout policy, cash holding, initial public offerings, small–medium enterprises and financial institutions is limited. Originality/value: This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the development of board diversity research (using a large archival database) and identifies the common construct as well as the potential opportunities for future research directions."

Using a large sample of US firms, we find a positive relationship between the existence of credit ratings and investment efficiency. The cross‐sectional analyses show the positive relationship is more pronounced for firms with greater information asymmetry and weaker corporate governance. Our results are robust to different methods to address potential endogeneity concerns, alternative measures of key variables, and the inclusion of additional control variables. Overall, the findings support the notion that credit rating agencies enhance information transparency and external monitoring, thereby allowing rated firms to promote investment efficiency. The findings contribute to our understanding of the significant role played by credit rating agencies in shaping firms' investment behaviour and efficiency."

Our study finds both independent and interaction effects of insider abnormal returns and CEO pay gap on the probability of CEO turnovers. First, an increase in insider purchase abnormal returns reduces the likelihood of CEO turnover, while an increase in insider sales abnormal returns signals a greater likelihood of CEO dismissal. Second, there is a negative impact of CEO pay gap on the probability of CEO turnover in insider purchases but not a positive impact of CEO pay gap on the probability of CEO turnover in insider sales. Third, the interaction between insider abnormal returns and CEO pay disparity mitigates the impact of insider returns and amplifies the impact of CEO pay gap on the probability of CEO dismissal. In particular, it reduces the positive effect of insider selling returns, offsets the negative effect of insider purchase returns, and magnifies the negative impact of CEO pay disparity on the likelihood of CEO dismissal in insider purchases."
